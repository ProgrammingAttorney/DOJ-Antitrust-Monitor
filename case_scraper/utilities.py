KGaA, \nPENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE, LLC, \nVIACOMCBS, INC., and \nSIMON & SCHUSTER, INC., \nDefendants. \nCivil Action No. 21-2886-FYP \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nJohn Steinbeck famously said, "I guess there are never enough books." He apparently \nmeant that in the figurative sense, as a comment on the power of books to educate, to enrich, and \nto explore. But today, his statement also rings true in the economic sense: The retail market for \nbooks in the United States was over $11.5 billion in 2019 and has only continued to expand. \nPeople want to read. And book publishers have the enormous power and responsibility to decide \nwhich books -\nand therefore which ideas and stories -\nwill be made broadly available to the \npublic. A publishers\' marketplace of ideas is also a marketplace of book sales, production costs, \nand market share. It is this commercial market, so inextricably intertwined with the intellectual \nlife of our nation, that the Court examines in this case. \nPenguin Random House ("PRH") is by far the largest book publisher in the United States. \nOwned by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA ("Bertelsmann"), an international media and services \ncompany, PRH annually publishes over 2,000 new books in the U.S. and generates nearly $2.5 \nbillion in revenue. Simon & Schuster, Inc. ("S&S"), owned by the media giant Paramount \nGlobal (formerly ViacomCBS), is the third-largest publisher in the U.S. S&S publishes about \n1,000 new titles yearly and reported over $760 million in net sales in 2020. \nIn March 2020, ViacomCBS announced that it planned to sell S&S. Following a multi\xad\nround bidding process, Bertelsmann and PRH signed an agreement with ViacomCBS and S&S in \nNovember 2020 to purchase S&S for $2.175 billion. The acquisition of S&S would cement \nPRH\' s position as the "number one" publisher in the United States, increasing its retail market \nshare to almost three times that of its closest competitor. 1 Trial Tr. at 741: 17-742:4 (Dohle). \nIn November 2021, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice \n("the government") brought this action against PRH, S&S, and their parent companies ("the \ndefendants"), seeking to block the merger of PRH and S&S under Section 7 of the Clayton Act. \nThe government\'s case sounds in "monopsony," a market condition where a buyer with too \nmuch market power can lower prices or otherwise harm sellers. Essentially, the government \nalleges that the merger will increase market concentration in the publishing industry, which will \nallow publishing companies to pay certain authors less money for the rights to publish their \nbooks. \nThe case proceeded to trial on August 1, 2022. For twelve days, the Court heard \nevidence and argument about how PRH\' s acquisition of S&S would affect competition in the \n"upstream" market for publishing rights. The Court heard testimony from authors, publishers, \n1 In \n2019, PRH had a - percent share of the market for U.S. book sales and S&S had a■ \npercent share. \nSee ECF No. 177 (United States\' Sealed Corrected Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law ("Govt. \nPFOF-PCOL")) ¶ 13 (citing Defendants\' Exhibit No. DX") 105 at 64); see also ECF No. 184 (government\'s \nredacted post-trial brief). Thus, the combined entity would have a market share of approximately \npercent. The \nmerged company\'s next closest competitor would be \nwhich had \npercent share of \nthe market for book sales in 2019. See Govt. PFOF-PCOL ¶ 13 (citing DX 105 at 64). \n2 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 2 of 80 \nliterary agents, and industry executives, and admitted over 230 exhibits. 2 After a thorough \nreview of the record and careful consideration of the parties\' arguments, the Court concludes that \nPRH\' s acquisition of S&S is likely to substantially lessen competition to acquire "the publishing \nrights to anticipated top-selling books," which comprise the relevant market in this case. The \nCourt therefore will enjoin the proposed merger of PRH and S&S. \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. The Industry \nThe book industry is dominated by five major publishing houses -PRH, HarperCollins \nPublishers, S&S, Hachette Book Group, and Macmillan Publishing Group, LLC -\nwhich are \nknown as the "Big Five." Together, the Big Five held nearly 60 percent of the market for the \nsale of trade books in 2021 (i.e., books intended for general readership, as opposed to specialized \nbooks like textbooks or manuals). See DX 382; PX 663 at 92. \n2 \nThe Court appreciated hearing the testimony of many dedicated professionals who work in the publishing \nindustry. The Court heard from authors Charles Duhigg, Stephen King, and Andrew Solomon. Publisher witnesses \nincluded: Jennifer Bergstrom, Senior Vice President and Publisher of the S&S imprint Gallery Books Group \n("Gallery"); Sally Kim, Senior Vice President and Publisher of the PRH imprint G.P. Putnam\'s Sons ("Putnam"); \nLiate Stehlik, President and Publisher of Morrow Group, HarperCollins Publishers; and Brian Tart, President and \nPublisher of the PRH imprint Viking Penguin ("Viking"). The following literary agents testified: Elyse Cheney, \nChristy Fletcher, Ayesha Pande, Gail Ross, Jennifer Rudolph Walsh (expert witness), and Andrew Wylie. The \nCourt also heard from top industry executives, including Markus Dohle, CEO of PRH; Dennis Eulau, Executive \nVice President and COO of S&S; John Glusman, Vice President and Editor in Chief of W.W. Norton & Company \n("Norton"); Michael Jacobs, President and CEO of Abrams Books; Jonathan Karp, President and CEO of S&S; \nMadeline McIntosh, CEO of PRH in the U.S.; Brian Murray, CEO of Harper Collins Publishers; Michael Pietsch, \nCEO of Hachette Book Group; Don Weisberg, CEO of Macmillan Publishers; and Steven Zacharius, CEO of \nKensington Books. The government\'s economic expert was Dr. Nicholas Hill, and the defendants\' economic expert \nwas Professor Edward Snyder. Finally, Adriana Porro, a statistician for U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust \nDivision, also testified. \nThe following witnesses testified by video: Christy Fletcher, John Glusman, Michael Jacobs, Andrew \nSolomon, Liate Stehlik, and Steven Zacharius. See Government\'s Exhibit No. ("PX") 2008 (Fletcher Dep.); Trial \nTr. at 1740:16-17 (noting that video of Fletcher\'s deposition was played at trial); DX 422 (Glusman Dep.); DX 423 \n(Glusman sealed); Trial Tr. at 1880:4 (noting that video of Glusman\'s deposition was played at trial); PX 2005 \n(Jacobs Dep.); Trial Tr. at at 701: 13-23 (noting that video of Jacobs\'s deposition was played at trial); PX 2004 \n(Solomon Dep.); Trial Tr. at 689:7-8 (noting that video of Solomon\'s deposition was played at trial). PX 2002 \n(Stehlik Dep.) at 64-65; Trial Tr. at 628:23 (noting that video of Stehlik\'s deposition was played at trial); PX 2000 \n(Zacharius Dep.); Trial Tr. at 385:11 (noting that video of Zacharius\'s deposition was played at trial). \n3 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 3 of 80 \nThe Big Five have achieved their market dominance in part by acquiring other publishers, \ncontributing to a trend toward consolidation in the industry. Bertelsmann entered the U.S. \npublishing market by acquiring Bantam Books in 1977, which merged with Doubleday Dell in \n1986 and with Random House in 1998. PRH itself was formed in 2013 when Random House \nacquired Penguin Books. Since 2013, PRH has continued to acquire other publishers, including \nSasquatch Books, Rodale, Little Tiger, F&W Media, and Sourcebooks. Meanwhile, Hachette \nhas acquired several independent publishers in the last decade, such as Workman Publishing, \nWorthy, Perseus, and Black Dog & Leventhal. See Trial Tr. at 102:13-103:4 (Pietsch), 204:3-\n19 (Pietsch). In 2021, HarperCollins acquired Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, which previously was \none of the largest among the mid-size, independent publishers. See Trial Tr. at 1386:12-17 \n(Murray), 192:6-193:15 (Pietsch). The remaining Big Five publisher, Macmillan, has pursued \norganic growth. See Trial Tr. at 1079:23-1080:18 (Weisberg). \nSome smaller publishers are well respected in the industry and compete against the Big \nFive -\nin both the upstream market for acquiring books for publication and in the downstream \nmarket for selling books to consumers. For instance, Scholastic is one of the largest children\'s \nbook publishers and works with some of the same authors as the Big Five, see Trial Tr. at \n118:20-22 (Pietsch), 545:10-547:2 (Karp); while Kensington, one of the largest remaining \nindependent publishers, is a prominent purveyor of romance novels. See PX 2000 (Zacharius) at \n8; PX 2002 (Stehlik) at 64-65. In addition, Norton is a prestigious publishing house specializing \nin narrative nonfiction and is favored by some best-selling authors like Michael Lewis. See Trial \nTr. at 540:24-541 :24 (Karp), 544:17-25 (Karp), 550:22-551 :4 (Karp); DX 422 at 7. Other \nplayers in the industry include well capitalized, mid-sized publishers like Amazon and Disney, \n4 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 4 of 80 \nwhich each bring in over $100 million in annual revenues from publishing. See Trial Tr. at \n737:22-738:11 (Dohle). \nEach publishing company is organized as an umbrella organization that houses various \n"imprints." An imprint is a trade name or brand name for an editorial group. Imprints specialize \nin publishing certain types of books and thus develop reputations for success in particular genres. \nSee PX 530 at 2. The editors within each imprint select and acquire manuscripts for publication; \nand then collaborate with authors to develop and finalize their books. See Trial Tr. at 97:1-6 \n(Pietsch), 1915:10-25 (Duhigg), 1919:8-1920:3 (Duhigg). PRH has close to 100 U.S. \npublishing imprints within six publishing divisions. See Trial Tr. at 812:5-11 (Dohle); Govt. \nDemo. 1 (PRH organizational chart). Its best-known imprints include Viking, Penguin Press, \nDoubleday, Riverhead, Random House, and Putnam. S&S operates three publishing groups with \naround 50 imprints, including Simon and Schuster, Atria Books, Scribner, and Gallery Books. \nSee PX 663 (materials for prospective S&S buyers) at 91, 101. \nAll publishers and editors are highly motivated to secure the rights to publish new books; \nindeed, identifying and acquiring books that people want to read is the essence of the business. \nYet only 3 5 out of 100 books tum a profit, and breakout titles drive revenues -\nthe top 4 percent \nof profitable titles generate 60 percent of profitability. See PX 151 (presentation by PRH \nexecutives on publishing industry) at 11; Trial Tr. at 747:16-18 (Dohle), 2289:2-10 (McIntosh) \n("Where the Crawdads Sing is a great current example. Fifty Shades of Grey, Gone Girl, Girl on \nthe Train . ... [their] sales performance so outstrips our expectation, that they deliver most of the \nprofit to the company."). Publishing has therefore been described by insiders as a "portfolio \nbusiness": The business model is to acquire a large number of high-quality books, knowing that \na substantial percentage of the titles will not be profitable. See Trial Tr. at 747:5-9 (Dohle). As \n5 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 5 of 80 \nPRH CEO Markus Dohle put it, publishers are "angel investors" that "invest every year in \nthousands of ideas and dreams, and only a few make it to the top." Id. at 747:5-9. The books \nthat do "make it to the top" and sell well, especially over a number of years, allow the companies \nto take risks in acquiring new books and enable publishers to manage the uncertainty inherent in \n"betting" on new titles. See id. at 747:5-7 (Dohle); PX 151 at 11. Books that continue to sell \nafter the first year of publication comprise a publisher\'s "back list," which can provide an \nimportant source of stable revenue. Back lists allow publishers to play the "long game" because \nsome books take a while to become profitable. See PX 2004 at 55. By contrast, the "front list," \nwhich consists of books not yet released or on the market for under a year, is risky and has \npoorer margins, due to the expenses of marketing and roll-out associated with the new titles. See \nTrial Tr. at 118:15-119:11 (Pietsch). \nB. Acquiring Books for Publication \nBooks begin, of course, with authors. Authors often spend years developing their ideas, \nconducting research, and refining their manuscripts or proposals before submitting them for \npublication. A project that is acquired may still take months or years of work before it becomes \na completed book that is ready for distribution. See, e.g., id. at 1916:14-21 (Duhigg). To \nsupport themselves, authors often rely on "advances" from their publishers. See id. at 1925: 15-\n22 (Duhigg), 1941:9-1943:1 (Duhigg) (advance allowed him to take time off from his job to \nwrite, support his newborn child, buy a house, and pay living expenses). An advance is an \nupfront payment against the royalties that an author may earn in the future. 3 The advance is the \n3 Royalties are payments made to the author based on a book\'s sales. See Trial Tr. at 106:20-107:25 \n(Pietsch). For example, authors earn 7 .5 percent of sales for paperback books. See id at 255 :24-256:20 (Pande ), \n2011:9-10 (Kim). An advance is an upfront payment of those anticipated royalties; the author is not required to pay \nback the advance even if the book\'s actual royalties never exceed the amount of the advance. See id at 106:20-\n107:25 (Pietsch). Advances are paid in installments, typically in quarters. Generally, the first installment is paid \nupon the signing of the book contract; the second payment is made upon delivery and acceptance of the manuscript; \n6 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 6 of 80 \n"single most important" term in a contract for publishing rights because in a "large number of \ncases, it may be the only compensation that the author will receive for their work." Id. at \n254:18-24 (Pande); see also PX 2002 (Stehlik) at 67. Indeed, most authors do not "earn out" \ntheir advances, i.e., ultimately earn royalties that exceed the amount of their advances. 4 In \naddition to the advance, authors care about working with editors who share their vision for the \nbook and who can help them to "bring the book into the world." Trial Tr. at 97:2-6 (Pietsch); \nsee also id. at 1918:5-24 (Duhigg), 1943:13-17 (Duhigg) (editor is "the reason I\'m there" at \nPRH), 2055:10-2056:9 (Cheney), 2063:5-17 (Cheney). \nAuthors generally are represented by literary agents, who use their judgment and \nexperience to find the best home for publishing a book. They typically begin the process by \nsubmitting the book (which might be a full or partial manuscript, or just a proposal) to multiple \nimprints or editors on a preliminary basis, to gauge the level of interest in the project. See id. at \n246: 11-22 (Pande ), 2105 :22- 25(Wylie ); PX 151 at 5. Agents use their expertise to determine \nwhich imprints and editors to target, based on factors such as the kinds of books the imprint \npreviously has published, how effectively they have published those kinds of books, and the \nability of the company to pay appropriate compensation. See Trial Tr. at 246:9-22 (Pande), \n2117:8-2118:25 (Ross). Agents prioritize submitting manuscripts and proposals to Big Five \nimprints because of their ability to pay; an agent might send out a second round of submissions \nthat includes more smaller publishers if interest among the Big Five is not strong. See id. at \n246:17-22 (Pande), 248:15-249:10 (Pande). Given the size of PRH and S&S, and the number of \nthe third installment is paid upon publication; and the fourth payment is made twelve months later. See id at 777:1-\n19 (Dohle), 1829:11-15 (Walsh), 255:1-25 (Pantle). It can take three to four years for an entire advance to be paid \nto an author. See id at 255:15-18 (Pantle), 777:1-19 (Dohle). \n4 \nSee Trial Tr. at 108:2-12 (Pietsch) ("Roughly half the time. About half the books we [Hachette] publish \nearn out their advances."), 254 :20-24 (Pan de) (20% of authors represented by Pan de\' s agency earned out advance), \n1239:25-1240:8 (Hill) (more than 85% of author contracts for anticipated top-selling books never earn out their \nadvance), 2101:3-5 (Wylie) (5% of books he represents earn out their advances). \n7 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 7 of 80 \nimprints they represent, some agents "always" submit to multiple PRH imprints and to S&S. See \nid. at 250:10-251 :3 (Pande), 260:16-21 (Pande). \nAgents try to maximize the advances paid to authors: They not only have a fiduciary \nduty to achieve the best deal, see id. at 494:7-17 (Karp), 1748:21-23 (Walsh), but they also are \npaid on commission (typically 15 percent of the advance). See id. at 245:18-25 (Pande); PX 151 \nat 5. Indeed, one prominent agent has stated that it is his job to "get an advance that an author \ndoesn\'t earn out," Trial Tr. at 2100:5-25 (Wylie); while a publisher explained that "typically the \nmost important thing for an agent representing authors [is] to get the most amount of money up \nfront," see PX 2002 (Stehlik) at 67. \nOther common terms in a book contract include royalty rates, audio rights, and payment \nstructure (i.e., the number and timing of the installments in which an advance is paid). See Trial \nTr. at 255:11-17 (Pande), 255:24-256:20 (Pande). Yet many of those other terms have become \nstandardized across the industry, making advance levels even more important. For instance, each \nbook format has a standard royalty rate that is rarely altered. See id. at 106 :20-107: 13 \n(Pietsch). 5 Audio rights are now always included in book contracts and may not be sold \nseparately. See id. at 257:14-258:6 (Pande), 622:17-25 (Karp); PX 328 (internal PRH email) at \n1-2 ("We have to get those [audio] rights."). Finally, even though authors prefer to receive \n"frontloaded" advances -\npayments that are made sooner, and in fewer installments -\nthe \nindustry norm has shifted in the opposite direction, from payouts in thirds to payouts in quarters. \nSee Trial Tr. at 254:25-255:3 (Pande), 256:22-25 (Pande), 1829:11-18 (Walsh); \n- at 19-\n20. \n5 Generally, paperback books receive a 7.5-percent royalty rate; e-books and audio or digital downloads \nreceive 25 percent of net sales; and hardcover books get a IO-percent rate for the first 5,000 copies sold, 12.5 percent \nfor copies 5,000 to 10,000, and 15 percent of sales exceeding 10,000 copies. See Trial Tr. at 255:24-256:20 \n(Pantle), 2011 :4-15 (Kim). \n8 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 8 of 80 \nThe Court is unconvinced by the testimony of certain defense witnesses who stated that \nadvance levels are not the most important factor in book acquisitions, and that the author\'s "fit" \nand comfort level with the editor are more significant. See Trial Tr. at 1756:2-1757:8 (Walsh), \n1836:5-1837:2 (Walsh), 1935:14-20 (Duhigg), 2055:5-2056:9 (Cheney), 2063:4-17 (Cheney). \nWhile that may be true in a small number of cases, books generally are sold to the highest bidder. \nSee id. at 2395:2-10 (McIntosh) (underbidder winning an auction is "rare"), 2090:20-23 (Wylie) \n("[W]e are picking one that we feel presents the strongest combination of financial terms plus \neditorial engagement and context for the author."), 2106:1-7 (Wylie) (sold books to the highest \nbidder about 93% of the time). While the choice of an editor is undoubtedly significant, the \nagent typically has submitted the book only to a pre-screened list of suitable editors and thus may \nchoose the highest bid from among those editors. See id. at 246:1-22 (Pande). The \noverwhelming weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that advance levels are the \nprimary focus of book acquisitions. \nMost books are sold in exclusive negotiations between the agent and a single editor or \nimprint. 6 Such negotiations come about because (1) a publisher has an "option" from a prior \ncontract with the author, which allows the publisher to take the first look at the author\'s next \nproject and submit an exclusive bid within a limited period; (2) a publisher is willing to pay a \npremium to "preempt" the book from being offered to others; (3) an agent approaches a single \neditor that is a particularly good fit for a book and enters negotiations with that editor and their \nimprint; or ( 4) only one imprint is interested after the agent has completed a round of \n6 \nMore than half of books are sold through negotiations. See Trial Tr. at 1608 :20-1609: 1 (Hill) ( explaining \nthat 60% of books with advances over $250,000 involve negotiations, with the remaining 40% being auctions); see \nalso id at 478:15-479:1 (Karp) (explaining that less than half of acquisitions are auctions because S&S has "so \nmany repeat authors), 771: 11-14 (Dohle) ( auctions are "small sliver of the overall deals we do, especially the \nexpensive deals we do"), 1963:20-1964:18 (Kim) (explaining that Putnam imprint buys 80% of books through one\xad\non-one negotiations and attributing the higher percentage to its number of "franchise" authors). \n9 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 9 of 80 \nsubmissions. See id. at 475:13-476:10 (Karp), 954:18-955:7 (Tart). Alternatively, an agent \nmight decide to utilize an auction format, which requires imprints to bid against each other to \nacquire the book. Auctions may be organized in (1) a "round robin" format, where the agent \naccepts competing bids in several "rounds," eliminates the lowest bidders before proceeding to \nthe next round, and continues until only one bidder remains; (2) a "best bids" format, where all \nbidders submit their highest bid in a single round; or (3) a hybrid format, such as "better best," \nwhere the bidding starts as a "round robin" and then shifts to a final round of "best bids." See id. \nat 111 :8-113:4 (Pietsch), 2049:1-19 (Cheney), 2116:10-2117:9 (Ross). \nA publisher that hopes to acquire a desirable book must offer a competitive advance to be \nin the running. Editors and publishers determine how much their imprint is willing to pay for a \ngiven book. See id. at 97: 1-6 (Pietsch). To make that determination, they estimate the \nprofitability of the book by generating a profit and loss statement ("P&L"). Such a statement \nsuggests an appropriate advance after considering (1) the anticipated sales of the book and its \nexpected list price (in various formats); and (2) predicted production and marketing costs. See \nDX 414 (P&L Sheet); Trial Tr. at 915:5-918:21 (Tart). The most important input in a P&L\xad\nand the driving force behind the advance offered- is the publisher\'s estimate of book sales. \nSee Trial Tr. at 917:13-16 (Tart) ("the higher ... sales equate to a higher advance in the P&L"), \n110: 19-111: 1 (Pietsch) (relationship between the level of advance and projected sales is \n"extremely close"). The sales prediction is based on the demand for comparable titles (referred \nto as "comp titles" or "comps"), which have similar characteristics to the proposed book in terms \nof subject matter, literary merit, or author background. Publishers also often confer with their \nsales, publicity, and marketing teams about expected demand for a book. See id. at 842:15-\n843:10 (Dohle), 914:11-18 (Tart), 1036:13-16 (Tart). But publishers do not rely only on the \n10 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 10 of 80 \nP&L to determine an appropriate advance. They also consider factors like the editor\'s \nenthusiasm, their relationship with the author, whether the book might win an award, and \nwhether the book is in a growing category -\nif they really want a book, they will "stretch" \nbeyond what a P&L suggests would be profitable. Id. at 969:4-970:14 (Tart), 967:3-10 (Tart). \nPublishers\' sales estimates, broadly speaking, are reasonably reliable. Ultimately, there \nis a correlation between high advances and high book sales. Books that sell well tend to have \ngarnered high advances, and books that receive high advances tend to sell well. See id. at 749:4-\n22 (Dohle); PX 151 at 11. \nC. The Competition for Books \nRegardless of the method used to acquire a book\'s publishing rights, the amount that is \npaid is inexorably determined by competition. In an auction, a skillful agent can capitalize on \nenthusiasm for a book and play bidders off against one another, knowing that a publisher will \n"bid what ... [it] need[ s] to buy that book" because "it [only] takes one passionate editor at \nanother imprint to win that book away." Trial Tr. at 1965:21-25 (Kim). Although the perceived \nvalue of a book is subjective and may vary among editors, there is often a consensus among \nindustry players about which books will be successful. See id. at 2108: 14-24 (Wylie) ("I think \nthere are recognizable qualities in -\nin books that people who have been in the business for a \nlong time would easily recognize."), 310:12-24 (Pantle) (agent explaining that she treats an \nanticipated strong seller differently, such as by "sending it out as widely as I possibly can"). \nIt is not uncommon for editors and publishers to experience a "kind of auction fever," in \nwhich they change their sales expectations for a book and increase what they are willing to pay \nfor it during a competitive round-robin auction. Id. at 180:20-181:11 (Pietsch). "[T]he interest \nof other parties validates [a publisher\'s] own sense of what a book is worth." Id. The record \n11 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 11 of 80 \ncontains numerous examples of books that sold for unexpectedly high advances and achieved \nother favorable terms for their authors due to the bidding frenzy incited by competitive auctions. \nFor instance, in a hybrid auction of rounds followed by best bids, \n, initially received bids of between $150,000 and $400,000 from four publishers. \nSee PX 944-B (Porro bidding summary); Trial Tr. at 923:16-930:18 (Tart) (discussing book\'s \nacquisition); PX 320 (emails). After six rounds of bidding, PRH\'s Viking imprint more than \ndoubled its initial bid and won the book for $775,000 "over stiff competition." PX 39 ( email \nfrom Tart); see also PX 944-B (Porro bidding summary); Trial Tr. at 923: 16-930: 18 (Tart). At \nthe best-bids stage, Viking decided to "stretch" from its initial bid clearance of $700,000 because \n"there just is literally no telling what the opponents hold in their hands." PX 326 at 1 ( emails \nbetween Tart and Viking editor Wendy Wolf). Another example is \n-\nwhich also benefitted from a rounds auction. See PX 948-B (Porro bidding \nsummary). In the first round, there were three bids, ranging from $200,000 to $300,000. See id. \nYet after five rounds, s,. received $535,000 plus a $100,000 bonus. See id.; Trial Tr. at \n433:24-435:17 (Karp) (discussing bidding process); PX 632 (emails discussing auction). The \nrecord contains at least 11 other examples that illustrate the sharp increase in prices engendered \nby competitive auctions, with advances increasing at least $100,000 by the end of the auction. 7 \n7 \nSee PX 937-B (one-round and best-bid auction with beginning high bid of $375,000 and winning bid of \n$550,000); PX 938-B (four-round and best-bid auction with beginning high bid of $250,000 and winning bid of \n$750,000); PX 716 (addressing auction summarized in PX 938-B); Trial Tr. at 435:21-437:19 (Karp) (same); PX \n939-B (seven-round auction with beginning high bid of $300,000 and winning bid of $1.5 million); PX 940-B (five\xad\nround and best-bid auction with beginning high bid of $400,000 and winning bid of $1.1 million for two books); PX \n941-B (eight-round auction with beginning high bid of $550,000 and winning bid of$825,000); PX 947-B (two\xad\nround and opportunity-to-improve auction with beginning high bid of $500,000 and winning bid of$600,000 and \nbonuses for two books); PX 950-B (three-round and best-bid auction with a chance to improve, with beginning high \nbid of $250,000 and winning bid of$700,000); PX 951-B (best-bid and opportunity-to-improve auction with initial \npreempt offer of $750,000 and winning bid of $1.1 million); PX 954-B (three-round and best-bid auction with \nbeginning high bid of$750,000 and winning bid of $1.05 million); PX 955-B (one-round auction with opportunity \nto improve, with beginning high bid of $800,000 and winning bid of $1.5 million); PX 729 (book initially received \n$750,000 preemptive offer from S&S, went to auction, and then S&S made an offer 10% higher than final auction \nbid, forofferof$1.l million); Trial Tr. at445:5-448:ll (Karp) (addressing book in PX 729). \n12 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 12 of 80 \nCompetition is also a key factor in one-on-one negotiations, where publishers must offer \nhigh advances because they know that the agent always has the option of breaking off \nnegotiations and selling the book on the market. See Trial Tr. at 955:11-20 (Tart) (explaining \nthat in one-on-one negotiations "you know there\'s competition out there"), 1847:1-6 \n(Bergstorm) ("I assume I am negotiating exclusively, but I always have my competition in my \nrearview mirror. But it\'s one on one. And sometimes we don\'t come to terms, and sometimes \nthey will go to someone else."), 1966:17-24 (Kim) ("[E]ven if it\'s a one-on-one negotiation ... \nwe\'re constantly aware that there\'s competition .... "), 114:21-115:6 (Pietsch). Some \npublishers consider individual negotiations to be the most challenging way to acquire a book, \nbecause "you are basically bidding against the author\'s expectations and the agent\'s \nexpectations," and there are "no other market inputs [but] you know there\'s competition out \nthere." Id. at 955: 11-20 (Tart). In such situations, agents have bargaining leverage because the \nthreat of taking the book to other publishers always lurks in the background. This is particularly \ntrue where a publisher is attempting to preempt the auction process. See, e.g., id. at 115 :21-\n116:5 (Pietsch) ("When we\'re calculating a preempt, we want to bring an advance that we \nbelieve the agent will consider a good advance; that they will think, yes, there\'s a chance that if I \ntake this to auction, I might not get this much or this is the range that it might end up at. And so \nwe try to offer a high advance that we think will be compelling to -\nto the agent .... "); 303: 13-\n15 (Pande) ("So preemptive offers tend to be quite high because it has to incentivize us to be \nwilling to take the book off the table and not offer it in a competitive situation."). As agent Gail \nRoss stated: "[I]n this business, there\'s always the other competitor. Whether ... they\'re \nbidding or not, they\'re always there." Id. at 2127:11-13. \n13 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 13 of 80 \nAgents often submit a book to more than one imprint within a publishing company, see \nid. at 250: 10-251 :3 (Pande ), and publishers sometimes allow their imprints to bid against one \nanother in auctions. For example, PRH allows competitive bidding between its divisions, so \nlong as there also is an external bidder; but for imprints within the same division, PRH requires \nthe division to submit a "house bid." See id. at 769:2-20 (Dohle), 935:20-936:1 (Tart), 943:3-\n24 (Tart); PX 332 (email from PRH staff to agent explaining imprint bidding rules). A house bid \nis a single bid made on behalf of more than one imprint from a particular publisher; the house bid \nallows the agent to choose which imprint to work with, and each imprint might also submit a \n"pitch," i.e., a letter or memo describing its editorial and other services. See PX 2002 (Stehlik) at \n75-76. Hachette also allows its imprints to bid against one another if there is an external bidder, \nsee Trial Tr. at 239: 11-23 (Pietsch), and Macmillan appears to allow some imprint competition, \ncompare PX 938-B (showing separate bids from two Macmillan imprints), with PX 941-B \n(showing house bid from Macmillan imprints), and PX 954-B (showing one bid from Macmillan \nimprints). S&S and HarperCollins, however, do not allow competitive bidding among their own \nimprints but instead require their imprints to submit house bids. See Trial Tr. at 463: 11-13 \n(Karp), 600:8-10 (Karp), 2119:11-24 (Ross); PX 2002 (Stehlik) at 75-76. Allowing sibling \nimprints to compete against each other increases the publisher\'s chances of winning a title; gives \nthe editors from each imprint the freedom to pursue their desired projects, and allows authors \nmore choice in finding the most "comfortable home" and best editorial match for their books. \nTrial Tr. at 839: 11-840:4 (Dohle ). \nAlthough internal competition may yield benefits to publishers and authors, it is not in a \npublisher\'s economic interest to allow its own imprints to drive up the price of an acquisition, \nand publishers therefore take steps to limit internal competition. See PX 411 (presentation by \n14 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 14 of 80 \nMadeline McIntosh to PRH Board) at 4 ( explaining that McIntosh had "[i]ncreased background \ncoordination in auctions to leverage internal demand information better and avoid internal \nupbidding"); Trial Tr. at 239: 11-23 (Pietsch) ("Once we have only Hachette imprints bidding, \nthen ... continuing to bid each other up would hurt the company\'s collective P&L."). Ample \nevidence in the record demonstrates that PRH imprints often coordinate their bids within the \nsame auction, artificially suppressing advances. See id. at 2341:9-2345:7 (McIntosh), 2373:9-\n2382:8 (McIntosh); PX 107 (email from McIntosh) ("I feel we should coordinate -\nshouldn\'t be \nforced into bidding against each other for existing authors"); PX 121 (emails between McIntosh \nand PRH executive Nina von Moltke) (coordinating imprint bids). For example, PRH imprints \nsometimes agree to submit the same bid. See PX 107 ("We are coordinated. Bill [Knopf \nDoubleday] and Kara [Random House] will agree to a number and both offer same."). They also \nsometimes arrange to start their bidding from a lower number. See PX 116 (emails between von \nMoltke and McIntosh) ( deciding that PRH imprints "go in a bit lower in round 1 "). Finally, PRH \nimprints sometimes decide to collectively "move up slowly" in their bidding, particularly if PRH \nis the "main driver of value." PX 336 (email from PRH executive to Tart). PRH appears to take \npride in its successful program of bid coordination. See PX 421 (email from von Moltke to \nMcIntosh) ( discussing auction where three top bids at $600,000 were from PRH imprints and \nnoting she was "[g]lad we didn\'t go higher (this one definitely benefitted from the \ncoordination!)"). This type of behavior from independent companies would be illegal. Cf \nUnited States v. Apple, Inc., 791 F.3d 290, 339 (2d Cir. 2015). \nIn competing for the most attractive new books, the Big Five have significant advantages \nover smaller publishers. Most critically, the Big Five have the capital to take chances and place \nbigger bets on a book\'s success; that is, they can offer higher advances for more books. Indeed, \n15 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 15 of 80 \nagents and authors choose the Big Five because "they are most likely to pay an appropriate \nadvance," see Trial Tr. at 246:19-22 (Pande); and at least one mid-size competitor observes that \nthe Big Five often "overpay" for books. See DX 422 (Glusman) at 76. The Big Five can afford \nto take on more risk by paying higher advances because they have the most substantial back lists, \nwhich are highly profitable. A book that does not sufficiently earn out its advance is a "loss" for \nthe publisher, 8 but a publisher that has a steady income stream from its back list has a higher \ntolerance for absorbing such losses. See Trial Tr. at 156:5-158:10 (Pietsch), 160:7-161:7 \n(Pietsch), 1066:22-25 (Weisberg) ("It[] ... obviously has an impact on the bottom line if [your] \nunearned advances are too large."). PRH has the largest back list in the industry, and its back list \nis the most significant source of its revenue. See id. at 2358:2-7 (McIntosh). \nThe Big Five also offer significant advantages in ensuring a book\'s presence in the media \nand visibility to its target audience. The Big Five publishers and their individual imprints have \nteams dedicated solely to selling, marketing, and publicizing books, which have built critical \nrelationships with booksellers and the media. See PX 2004 (Solomon) at 64 ("There\'s just a \nwhole industry that responds better to Big Five publishers."); Trial Tr. at 259:13-260:4 (Pande), \n840:5-841: 12 (Dohle ), 983: 12-25 (Tart). Big Five publicity teams "engage with the media to \npromote the book." Trial Tr. at 1047:16-20 (Tart). Those teams can secure author interviews \non prominent programs like the Today Show, Good Morning America, or NPR, and can \npersuade senior book reviewers to closely read and review the book. See PX 2004 (Solomon) at \n63-64. 9 \nA book need not earn out its entire advance for a publisher to profit; publishers begin to profit "at around \n70 percent of earnout for most books." See Trial Tr. at 1240:9-12 (Hill), 2258:21-25 (McIntosh). \n9 \nSee PX 2004 (Solomon) at 63-64. ("You know, your book comes out and what do you want; you want to \nbe on NPR, you want to be on Good Morning America or the Today Show, you want to ... do a radio interview \nwith Terry Gross .... The publishers at the Big Five houses have more ready access to all of that. And ... if there is \na new book that [S&S imprint] Scribner said is a really major title, it will at least be closely read by the editors of \n16 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 16 of 80 \nThe Big Five\'s sales teams can help ensure that stores not only buy books but place them \nin prominent displays. See Trial Tr. at 174:19-175:5 (Pietsch), 1372:11-25 (Murray), 1378:4-\n1379:9 (Murray); PX 2002 (Stehlik) at 112 ("I would say generally the Big Five seem to have \nmore visibility in stores ... than other smaller publishers."). The Big Five edge extends to the \nvirtual marketplace; for instance, PRH hires data scientists to study Amazon\'s search algorithms \nand spends money to get books better positioned in Amazon\'s search results. See Trial Tr. at \n893:6-16 (Dohle); PX 2002 (Stehlik) at 112. \nMeanwhile, marketing teams are responsible for paid advertising and use "every device \npossible to find that [book\'s] audience." See Trial Tr. at 1067:17-1068:14 (Weisberg). In \nservice of that goal, they produce market research and data analytics, as well as send marketing \nmaterials to traditional outlets or social media influencers. See id. at 983:12-25 (Tart), 1849:13-\n25 (Bergstrom), 1938:5-12 (Duhigg). The Big Five can even ensure that books look better when \nthey reach an audience, providing multiple versions of cover art for an author to choose from. \nSee PX 2001 (Zacharius) at 3 7 (\' \nTrial Tr. at 1920:4-13 (Duhigg) \n("[Random House] came up with something like 13 or 15 different mockup book jackets to try \nand figure out like which one is going to attract the reader\'s eyes when it\'s sitting there on a \nshelf and get them to pick it up."). \nbook reviews in a way that a book coming from a more obscure press is likely to go to a junior reader"); Trial Tr. at \n1047:16-20 (Tart), 167:17-168:9 (Pietsch) ("And so to get [the media] to pay attention to your emails or return your \nphone calls or come out to lunch or come to your pitch event, it takes a long time in developing a lot of \ncredibility."), 1372:11-25 (Murray) ("And then we have publicists who have relationships with television and radio \nproducers."). \n17 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 17 of 80 \nBy contrast, smaller publishers might have a handful of staff doing all the editing, \nmarketing, publicity, and sales work on a book. See id. at 259:13-260:4 (Pande). Although \nsome of their books do well, that success is harder won and less frequent. See PX 2004 \n(Solomon) at 64 ("[T]here\'s some fabulous books that are published by other houses and some of \nthem end up being successful. But it\'s harder when you have fewer resources. It\'s easier when \nyou have more resources."). Authors want the easy advantages offered by the Big Five\'s strong \npublicity, marketing, and sales teams. 10 Authors know that "when a publisher really gets behind \na book, particularly a big publisher, the chances are that that book is going to probably succeed \non some level." See Trial Tr. at 335:23-336:1 (King). \nSuccessful authors who first publish with smaller publishers often prefer to publish their \nnext book with a Big Five publisher. See id. at 291 :10-292:25 (Pande). Along with their \nsubstantial resources, Big Five publishers have developed a valuable reputation for having strong \neditorial staff with experience working with the best books and authors. See PX 530 at 2 \n( opining that Big Five "are known for their strong editorial ... skills"). 11 Thus, a second book \nwith a Big Five publisher gives the author a better chance of an even bigger success. See Trial \nTr. at 291: 10-292:25 (Pande). The Big Five view the smaller publishers as a "farm team" for \nspotting writing talent, and routinely lure authors away from the non-Big Five publishers with \nhigher advances and the promise of superior marketing, distribution, and even cover design. See \n10 \nSee PX 2002 (Stehlik) at 101 ("Most authors want to have their books in as many locations as possible."), \n112 (suggesting that visibility is one reason "why many agents and authors prefer to go with bigger publishers"). \nII \nSee also Trial Tr. at 353:8-25 (Eulau) (acknowledging that "reputation is important" for attracting authors), \n454:11-22 (Karp) (agreeing that S&S\'s decades of credibility and success attracts authors), 535:7-20 (Karp) (noting \nthat a Macmillan imprint has "a long reputation, so they can claim that when they publish a writer, that writer will be \nfollowing in the tradition of other great award-winning Nobel laureates"), 1375:24-1376:23 (Murray) ("[To acquire \ntop authors,] [y]ou have to have ... expertise and a reputation. It helps if you have published authors that are \npublishing to the similar readers, you know, so you can point to similar books that maybe you published one, two, or \nthree years ago that were successful."), 2005:15-2006:18 (Kim) ("[A]uthors want to be published by publishers with \ngood reputations, good standing, you know, with booksellers and media. They want to be a part of a list that they \ncan be proud to say they\'re a part of."). \n18 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 18 of 80 \nPX 530 at 2 (explaining that small publishers "become farm teams for authors who then want to \nmove to a larger, more financially stable major publisher"); Trial Tr. at 291 :10-292:25 (Pande), \n335:412 (King) (describing smaller publishers as the "minor leagues for writers"). The trial \nrecord contains many examples of authors who moved from non-Big Five publishers to the Big \nFive after establishing a track record of success. See Trial Tr. at 292:6-12 (Pande) ("I have had \nseveral authors who have moved from small publishers to larger publishers. One of the authors\' \nname is Lad[ ee] Hubbard. Her first book was published by Melville House. And for her second \nbook, she moved to [HarperCollins]. My author Lisa Ko moved from Algonquin to Penguin \nRandom House."); DX 423 (Glusman) at 15-19 \nOf course, there are exceptions, as the defendants point out. \nSee, e.g., ECF No. 178 (Defendants\' Sealed Proposed Findings of Fact) ¶70 (citing PX 2001 \n(Zacharius)) \nsee also ECF No. 182 (Defendants\' Redacted Proposed Conclusions of \nLaw)¶¶ 9-10). 12 \nSelf-publishing is not a significant factor in the publishing industry. Self-published \nbooks are rarely published in print and are typically limited to online distribution. See Trial Tr. \nat 173: 13-23 (Pietsch), 1108 :2-9 (Weisberg). The authors of self-published books cannot pay \nthemselves an advance. See id. at 173:8-15 (Pietsch) (remarking that for advances above \n$100,000, "I do not consider [ self-publishing] a threat at all because ... [ s ]elf-published authors \n12 \nDefendants proposed conclusions of fact and law are contained in the same document (ECF No. 178) but \nare separately enumerated. The Court will refer to the proposed conclusions of fact as "Defs. PFOF" and proposed \nconclusions of law as "Defs. PCOL." \n19 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 19 of 80 \ncan\'t pay themselves an advance against royalties"). Moreover, individual authors generally do \nnot have relationships with media or distributors necessary to ensure that their books are visible \nto a potential audience. See id. at 173:13-23 (Pietsch) ("Self-published authors ... don\'t have \nthe ability to attract the attention of media .... Imagine how hard it is ... for one person who has \na book they published entirely on their own to say: Give me your attention. Review my book. \nPromote my book. And so they simply don\'t have access to the general-interest market that we \nand the other Big 5 publishers address routinely. That\'s our business."). In short, self\xad\npublishing cannot compete with the experience and resources of publishing companies. See id. \nat 173:13-174:2 (Pietsch); PX 2004 (Solomon) at 52-53 ("I think a commercial publisher sells \nmore books, garners more reviews, gains more attention, does all kinds of things .... I [ as an \nauthor] don\'t have all of those business competencies that are involved."); see also Trial Tr. at \n2898:8-18 (Snyder) (positing that "self-publishing is not a relevant constraint"). \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nSection 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits mergers and acquisitions "where in any line of \ncommerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such \nacquisition may be substantially to lessen competition." 15 U.S.C. § 18. The "fundamental \npurpose" of Section 7 is "to arrest the trend toward concentration, the tendency to [ monopoly or \nmonopsony], before the [buyer\'s or seller\'s] alternatives disappear[] through merger .... " \nUnited States v. Phi/a. Nat\'! Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 367 (1963). Thus, Congress "sought to assure \n... the courts the power to brake this force at its outset and before it gathered momentum." \n20 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 20 of 80 \nBrown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 317-18 (1962). 13 \nTo this end, "Congress used the words may be substantially to lessen competition to \nindicate that its concern was with probabilities, not certainties." FTC v. HJ. Heinz Co., 246 F.3d \n708, 713 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (emphasis in original) (cleaned up) (quoting Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at \n323). The government "must prove the alleged Clayton Act violation by a preponderance of the \nevidence," i.e., that the merger would more likely than not violate the statute; but "\'[S]ection 7 \ndoes not require proof that a merger or other acquisition will cause higher prices [ or \nanticompetitive effects] in the affected market. All that is necessary is that the merger create an \nappreciable danger of such consequences in the future."\' United States v. Anthem, Inc., 236 F. \nSupp. 3d 171, 192 (D.D.C. 2017) (first quoting United States v. SunGard Data Sys., Inc., 172 F. \nSupp. 2d 172, 180 (D.D.C. 2001); and then quoting Hosp. Corp. of Am. v. FTC, 807 F.2d 1381, \n1389 (7th Cir. 1986)). 14 Section 7\'s probabilistic standard "creates a relatively expansive \ndefinition of antitrust liability" and "subjects mergers to searching scrutiny." California v. Am. \nStores Co., 495 U.S. 271, 284 (1990). 15 \n13 \nThe government\'s theory is that the combined defendants would exercise market power on the buy-side of \nthe publishing market, i.e., monopsony. Although most antitrust law has developed under sell-side theories of harm, \ni.e., monopoly, monopsony analysis relies on similar principles. Under the Horizontal Merger Guidelines, discussed \ninfra at n.15, "to evaluate whether a merger is likely to enhance market power on the buying side of the market, the \nAgencies employ essentially the framework described ... for evaluating whether a merger is likely to enhance \nmarket power on the selling side of the market." U.S. Dep\'t of Justice & Fed. Trade Comm\'n, Horizontal Merger \nGuidelines § 12 (2010), https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/atr/legacy/2010/08/19/hmg-2010.pdf ("Merger \nGuidelines"). "The kinship between monopoly and monopsony suggests that similar legal standards should apply to \nclaims of monopolization and to claims of monopsonization." Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood \nLumber Co., 549 U.S. 312, 321-22 (2007). "Monopsony and monopsony power are the equivalent on the buying \nside of monopoly and monopoly power on the selling side." United States v. Syufy Enters. 903 F.2d 659,663 n.4 \n(9th Cir. 1990) ( quotations omitted). \n14 \nAlthough defendants quote United States v. Marine Bancorporation, 418 U.S. 602, 623 n.22 (1974), for the \nproposition that a merger\'s anticompetitive effects must also be "imminent" to violate the Clayton Act, see Defs. \nPCOL ¶ 1, the full quotation from that case is that "the loss of competition \'which is sufficiently probable and \nimminent\' is the concern of§ 7," Marine Bancorp., 418 U.S. at 623 n.22 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). The \nCourt understands that description of the standard to be functionally indistinguishable from the D.C. Circuit\'s \nformulation of the Section 7 standard, as described above. \n15 \nIn United States v. AT&T, Inc., the D.C. Circuit described the Section 7 standard of proof as follows: \n"[T]he government must show that the proposed merger is likely to substantially lessen competition, which \n21 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 21 of 80 \nAlthough "Congress neither adopted nor rejected specifically any particular tests for \nmeasuring the relevant markets [where commerce is affected] ... [n]or [defined] ... the word \n\'substantially,"\' Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 320-21, the D.C. Circuit has taken a burden-shifting \napproach to Section 7 cases. See AT&T, Inc., 916 F.3d at 1032; Heinz, 246 F.3d at 715; United \nStates v. Baker Hughes Inc., 908 F.2d 981, 982-83 (D.C. 1990). The Baker Hughes test, as it \nhas come to be known, has a preliminary requirement and three steps. At the threshold, the \ngovernment must demonstrate the existence of a relevant market. See Marine Bancorp., 418 \nU.S. 602,618 (1974); FTC v. RAG-Stiftung, 436 F. Supp. 3d 278, 291-92 (D.D.C. 2020). Once \nit has done so, the first step of the test allows the government to establish a prima facie case and \na presumption of anticompetitive effects by demonstrating undue concentration within that \nrelevant market. See Anthem, 855 F.3d at 349; Heinz, 246 F.3d at 715. The second step shifts \nthe burden to the defendants, who must demonstrate in rebuttal that real-world conditions make \nmarket concentration alone an unreliable predictor of the merger\'s anticompetitive effects. See \nAnthem, 855 F.3d at 349-50; Heinz, 246 F.3d at 715. If the defendants successfully rebut the \nprima facie case, the burden shifts back to the government in the third step "and merges with the \nencompasses a concept of \'reasonable probability."\' 916 F.3d 1029, 1032 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (emphasis deleted) \n(quoting Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 323 n.39). The parties dispute the meaning of this language. The defendants \nargue that AT& "require[s the government] to prove that a merger is \'likely\' to cause substantial harm to \ncompetition, [not] only that harm \'may\' occur." Defs. PCOL ¶ 2. The government points to AT&Ts explanation \n"that this standard encompasses a concept of \'reasonable probability,"\' arguing that AT&T requires something less \nthan what the defendants propose. See Govt. PFOF-PCOL ¶¶ 38, 40; see also id ¶ 38 (arguing for an "appreciable \ndanger" standard). The root of these competing formulations may be uncertainty over how the government\'s \npreponderance-of-the-evidence burden interacts with Section 7\'s already probabilistic standard; combined, the two \nstandards require the government to prove "by a preponderance of the evidence" that the effect of a challenged \nmerger or acquisition "may be substantially to lessen competition." Anthem, 236 F. Supp. 3d at 192. Like the \ndistrict court in AT&T, this Court "need not further toil over discerning or articulating the daylight, if any, between \n\'appreciable danger,\' \'probable,\' \'reasonably probable,\' and \'likely\' as used in the Section 7 context." United States \nv. AT&T, 310 F. Supp. 3d 161, 189 n.16 (D.D.C. 2018). The selection of any of the competing permutations is not \noutcome-determinative in this case. \n22 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 22 of 80 \nultimate burden of persuasion, which remains with the government at all times." Baker Hughes, \n908 F.2d at 983; accord Anthem, 855 F.3d at 350. \nIII. ANALYSIS \nThe government contends that the merger of PRH and S&S would harm competition to \nacquire the publishing rights to "anticipated top-selling books," resulting in lower advances for \nthe authors of such books and less favorable contract terms. The defendants do not dispute that \nif advances are significantly decreased, some authors will not be able to write, resulting in fewer \nbooks being published, less variety in the marketplace of ideas, and an inevitable loss of \nintellectual and creative output. See Trial Tr. at 772:8-25 (Dohle). The defendants vigorously \ncontest, however, whether advances would decrease after the merger: They contend that \ncompetition would not be harmed and that advances would actually rise. \nA. Market Definition \nThe first step in merger analysis is the identification of a relevant market. See Marine \nBancorp., 418 U.S. at 618. Market definition "helps specify the line of commerce and section of \nthe country in which the competitive concern arises"; and allows the Court to evaluate any \nanticompetitive effects by "identify[ing] market participants and measur[ing] market shares and \nmarket concentration." Merger Guidelines§ 4. 16 "Determination of the relevant market is a \nnecessary predicate to a finding of a violation of the Clayton Act because the threatened \nmonop[sony] must be one which will substantially lessen competition \'within the area of \neffective competition.\'" United States v. E.L du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U.S. 586, 593 \n16 \nThe Merger Guidelines "outline the principal analytical techniques, practices, and the enforcement policy \nof the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission" for merging competitors under federal antitrust \nlaws. Merger Guidelines § 1. They "describe the principal analytical techniques and the main types of evidence on \nwhich the Agencies usually rely to predict whether a horizontal merger may substantially lessen competition." Id \nAlthough the Merger Guidelines are not binding, courts have consistently looked to them for guidance in merger \ncases. See, e.g., FTC v. Sysco C01p., 113 F. Supp. 3d 1, 38 (D.D.C. 2015). \n23 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 23 of 80 \n(1957) (quoting Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 299 n.5 (1949)). But \ndefining a relevant market is not an end unto itself; rather, it is an analytical tool used to \nascertain the "locus of competition." Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 320-21; see also Merger \nGuidelines § 4.1.1 ("[T]he purpose of defining the market and measuring market shares is to \nilluminate the evaluation of competitive effects."). Accordingly, the Supreme Court has \nemphasized that market definition under the Clayton Act was intended by Congress to be "a \npragmatic, factual" analysis and "not a formal, legalistic one." Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 336. \nMarket definition has two components: the relevant geographic market and the relevant \nproduct market. See Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 324; Anthem, 236 F. Supp. 3d at 193. Here, the \nparties agree that the relevant geographic market is the global market for the acquisition of U.S. \npublishing rights. See Govt. PFOF-PCOL ¶ 125; ECF No. 1 (Complaint) ¶ 40; ECF No. 56 \n(Amended Answer) ¶ 40 (agreeing "that Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster compete \nwith each other and with many other publishers to acquire rights to publish books in the United \nStates and that authors who sell U.S. publishing rights can reside anywhere in the world."). The \nparties strenuously dispute, however, the boundaries of the appropriate product market. \nThe government defines the relevant product market as the one for publishing rights to \nanticipated top-selling books. See Govt. PFOF-PCOL ¶¶ 15, 63. Anticipated top-selling books \nare those that are expected to yield significant sales, and for which authors therefore receive \nhigher advances. See id. ¶ 15. The government contends that such books have distinctive \ncharacteristics, including the need for extra marketing, publicity, and sales support to allow them \nto reach broader audiences. See id. ¶¶ 15, 64-68, 87, 93-119. \nThe proposed market for anticipated top-selling books is a submarket of the broader \npublishing market for all trade books. See id. ¶ 124; see also Defs. PCOL ¶ 9-10 ( explaining \n24 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 24 of 80 \nthat the "market for the acquisition of all U.S. trade books" is an appropriate, broader market). \nUnder the government\'s monopsony theory, the authors of anticipated top-selling books are \n"targeted sellers" against whom the merged defendants might lower the prices paid for the \nauthors\' wares. See Govt. PFOF-PCOL ¶¶ 55-58, 69-76; see also Merger Guidelines§ 4.1.4 (If \na monopsonist could "profitably target a subset of [sellers] for price [ de ]creases, the \n[government] may identify relevant markets defined around those targeted [sellers]."); of FTC v. \nWith. Wilhelmsen Holding ASA, 341 F. Supp. 3d 27, 46-47 (D.D.C. 2018) ("[A]ntitrust markets \ncan be based on targeted customers"); Sysco, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 38-40 (discussing definition of \nmarkets based on targeted customers). In the monopsony context, "[a] submarket exists when \n[buyers] can profitably [cut] prices to certain targeted [sellers] but not to others, in which case \nregulators may evaluate competitive effects separately by type of [seller]." Anthem, 236 F. Supp. \n3d at 195 ( cleaned up). \nCourts evaluate relevant product markets in the monopsony context in two ways: by \nconsidering qualitative, "practical indicia" as described by the Supreme Court in the Brown Shoe \ncase, 370 U.S. at 325; and by examining "supply substitution" and applying the "hypothetical \nmonopsonist test," which are discussed in detail, infra. The parties in this case focus their \narguments on whether "practical indicia" support the finding of a market to publish "anticipated \ntop-selling books." Because the parties choose to fight on the battlefield of "practical indicia," \nthat is where the Court begins its analysis. \n1. Practical Indicia \n"[W]ithin [a] broad market, well-defined submarkets may exist which, in themselves, \nconstitute product markets for antitrust purposes. The boundaries of such a submarket may be \ndetermined by examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition of the \n25 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 25 of 80 \nsubmarket as a separate economic entity, the product\'s peculiar characteristics and uses, unique \nproduction facilities, distinct [sellers], distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and \nspecialized vendors." Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325. These indicia are "practical aids" as \nopposed to "talismanic" criteria "to be rigidly applied," FTC v. Swedish Match, 131 F. Supp. 2d \n151, 159 (D.D.C. 2000) (cleaned up); thus, "submarkets can exist even if only some of these \nfactors are present." FTC v. Staples, Inc., 970 F. Supp. 1066, 1075 (D.D.C. 1997) ("Staples I"). \nBrown Shoe\'s practical indicia also may help identify a market of targeted sellers. See \nFTC v. Whole Foods Market, Inc., 548 F.3d 1028, 1038-39 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing Brown Shoe, \n370 U.S. at 325). For example, a market of "distinct [sellers]," as posited by the government, \nmay find "a particular [set of buyers] \'uniquely attractive"\' and "the only realistic choice" for \ntheir products. Id. (first citing Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325; then quoting Nat\'! Collegiate \nAthletic Ass\'n v. Ed. of Regents of the Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85, 111 (1984); and then quoting \nSuperTurf, Inc. v. Monsanto Co., 660 F.2d 1275, 1278 (8th Cir. 1981)). \ni. The $250,000 Threshold \nTo identify the books that are anticipated to sell well, the government focuses on the \ncriterion of "distinct pricing": For analytical purposes, it defines anticipated top-selling books as \nthose for which publishers pay an advance of at least $250,000. See Govt. PFOF-PCOL ¶ 64; \nBrown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325 (explaining that "distinct prices" are probative in market \ndefinition); see also Whole Foods, 548 F.3d at 1038-39 (explaining distinct prices paid by \ntargeted group of customers "indicate[] the existence of a submarket of core customers"); Syufy \nEnters. v. Am. Multicinema, Inc., 793 F.2d 990, 995 (9th Cir. 1986) (considering "lucrative terms \noffered for the pictures by exhibitors" to define relevant market). Books that meet the $250,000-\nadvance threshold comprise only 2 percent of all book acquisitions, but they account for 70 \n26 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 26 of 80 \npercent of all advance spending amounting to $1 billion annually. See Govt. PFOF-PCOL ft \n15 68 (citing Trial Tr. at 1239:10-24 (Hill) 2904:17-2905:3 (Snyder)). Governments Exhibit -\n963 shows that the market shares of industry participants in the proposed publishing market for \nanticipated top-selling books are far more concentrated than in the market for publishing books \nat lower advance levels: \n• Non-Big 5 \n■ Penguin Random House \n• -\n• Simon & Schuster \n• -\n• -\n100% -\n90% \n80% \n70% \n0 \n0 \n40% \nf \nt5 \n30% \n10% \n0% \nAnticipated Top Sellers \nSource: Snyder Advance Data. \nNon-Anticipated Top Sellers \nIn the publishing market for anticipated top-selling books, the Big Five publishers hold 91 \npercent of the market share, while smaller publishers collectively hold only 9 percent. PX 963. \nBy contrast, in the publishing market for books that earn advances below $250 000, the non-Big \nFive publishers have a much more substantial market share of 45 percent. Id. \nAs an initial matter the government s use of high advances as a proxy for anticipated \nbook sales is logical and supported by market realities. In publishing advances are correlated \nwith expected sales because books that are expected to sell well receive higher advances. See \nsupra Section I.B. In fact advance levels are set by using P&L\'s, and the defining feature of a \n27 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 27 of 80 \nP&L is the sales estimate. See id.· Trial Tr. at 917: 13- 16 (Tart) ("[T]he higher . . . sales equate \nto a higher advance in the P&L. ). Moreover industry practices indicate that $250,000 is a \nreasonable place to draw the line: S&S and two of the three PRH adult divisions require \napproval from senior publishers or executives for advance offers of $250 000 or more; and \nPublishers Marketplace, a major industry publication categorizes deals for $2501000 or more as \n\'significant.\' 17 See Trial Tr. at 1233:5- 135 (Hill) 459:5-8 Karp), 1993:1- 3 (Kim), 914:22-\n915:2 (Tart), 2261:12- 2262:5 (McIntosh); PX 989 \nThis evidence is probative of "industry or \npublic recognition"  of a distinct category of books that 1·eceive advances at or above the \n$250 000 level. Brown Shoe 370 U.S. at 325. \nThe defendants take aim at the $250,000 threshold that the government has chosen to \nbound the market. \nSee Defs. PCOL ¶¶ 23-25, 28-41 . Most significantly, they argue that the \n$250,000 threshold is either too high or too low to define a submarket \n,\nfor anticipated top selling \nbooks. Id. ¶¶ 28-41; Defs. PFOF ff 33-43. Specifically, the defendants rely on their Exhibit \n438 to argue that the advance threshold should be set at $50,000 to capture the point at which the \nBig Five begin to dominate the market for acquiring books: \nAs for other Big Five publishers,  Hachette does not have a company-wide approval policy, but its different \nimprints require approval for offers from above $100,000 to above $250,000. See Trial Tr. at 232:21- 233:5 \n(Pietsch) (\'\'All our publishers have advance approval levels and they are clustered right around $250.000 " . \nHachette also tracks the books it lost for advances of $500,000 or more. See PX 790 . \n. See Trial Tr. at 1438:8-11 (Murray) \n28 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 28 of 80 \nOr.

PFOF 37 ("[T]he data establish that if competitive conditions differ based on market \nshares and author preferences the difference begins with books acquired for advances of \n$50 000 or more," where the market share of non-Big Five publishers is reduced from 58% to \n17%.); Defs. PCOL ¶¶ 31-34. Alternatively, the defendants contend that the threshold should be \nset at $1 million to identify the books b celebrity franchise or award-winning authors that are \nmost clearly destined for success. See Defs. PFOF ¶¶ 37-40; Defs. PCOL ¶¶ 35-41. If the \nrelevant market were prope1·ly defined at the lower ($50,000) or higher ($1 million) advance \nlevel, the defendants urge, the government could not show a sufficient decrease to competition or \nharm to authors. See Defs. PFOF ¶¶ 38 42-43. \nThe defendants\' excessive concern over the specific dollar threshold betrays a \nmisunderstanding of why the threshold was chosen. The market that the government seeks to \ndefine is the one for anticipated top-selling books, and the $250,000 demarcation was adopted \nonly as an analytical tool to help it group together the books in question. The government\'s \neconomic expert, Dr. Nicholas Hill also conducted his analyses at other numerical thresholds \n(including $150,000, $250 000, $500 000, and $1 million) and observed consistent outcomes at \nthose various high-dollar amounts. See PX 960· Trial Tr. at 1254:7- 25 (Hill) 1259:2- 12 (Hill) \n29 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 29 of 80 \n1233:14-20 (Hill). Thus, the $250,000 cutoff is merely useful; it is not intended to be a rigid \nbright line, but rather is helpful "[f]or analytical purposes" to facilitate the assessment of anti\xad\ncompetitive effects. FTCv. Staples, Inc., 190 F. Supp. 3d 100,118 & n.10 (D.D.C. 2016) \n("Staples II") ("[T]here is no \'magic place that\'s the right place\' to draw the line." (quoting \ngovernment expert\'s testimony)). Accordingly, the Court rejects this argument against the \ngovernment\'s defined market. \nThe Court is unswayed by the defendants\' tactic of enumerating other markets or \nsubmarkets in which competition would not be harmed by the merger. In addition to proposing \nsubmarkets at the $50,000- and $1 million- advance levels, the defendants also declare that the \ngovernment could not prove anticompetitive effects from the merger in the broad market of \npublishing rights for all U.S. trade books, or in the downstream market for retail book sales. See \nDefs. PFOF ¶¶ 29-31. Those protestations are beside the point because the Clayton Act \nprohibits mergers that may substantially lessen competition "in any line of commerce or in any \nactivity affecting commerce." 15 U.S.C. § 18 ( emphasis added). Thus, even if alternative \nsubmarkets exist at other advance levels, or if there are broader markets that might be analyzed, \nthe viability of such additional markets does not render the one identified by the government \nunusable. See United States v. Cont\'l  Can Co., 378 U.S. 441, 456-58 (1964) (validating a \nrelevant product market of glass and metal containers, even though "there may be a broader \nproduct market made up of metal, glass and other competing containers"); United States v. \nAluminum Co. of Am., 377 U.S. 271, 275 (1964) (explaining that even though insulated \naluminum conductor and insulated copper conductor could both be in "a single product market," \nthat "does not preclude their division for purposes of [Section] 7 into separate submarkets"); see \nalso Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325; Anthem, 236 F. Supp. 3d at 201-02. \n30 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 30 of 80 \nAmple precedent supports the government\'s use of a numerical cutoff to identify a \nsubmarket. It is common for courts to use seemingly arbitrary criteria to home in on a segment \nof a broader industry. See Wilhelmsen, 341 F. Supp. 3d at 51 (market of customers with fleets of \n10 or more global maritime vessels); Anthem, 236 F. Supp. 3d at 195 (market of companies with \n5,000 or more employees); Staples II, 190 F. Supp. 3d at 118 (market of customers who spend \n$500,000 or more annually on office supplies). In Wilhelmsen, Judge Chutkan approved a \nrelevant market "defined around the FTC\' s preferred set of targeted customers" -\n"Global \nFleets." 341 F. Supp. 3d at 48, 58. The government characterized "Global Fleets" as "fleets of \n10 or more globally trading vessels." Id. at 51. Although the defendants argued "that the Global \nFleets construct is premised on arbitrary thresholds," the court found that such fleets "are a \ndistinct group with distinct needs," even though the "choice of ten globally trading vessels was \narbitrary in the sense that the number ten is not compelled by a specific market reality." Id. at \n51-54. Judge Chutkan explained that the government\'s expert "chose ten as a starting point for \ndeveloping a series of statistical estimates, the non-statistical implications of which support the \nappropriateness of regarding Global Fleets as a distinct customer group." Id. at 55. In other \nwords, the cutoff of ten ships to define "Global Fleets" was an appropriate analytical tool, just as \nthe choice of a $250,000-minimum advance level to define "anticipated top-selling books" is \nappropriate for analytical purposes. At bottom, such "construct[ s ]" provide a "useful way to \ndiscuss and predict economic conditions" because their "key aspects correspond to elements of \nthe existing marketplace that would make it possible to profitably target a subset of customers \n[or sellers] for price increases [or decreases] post-merger." Id. at 52 (quoting Sysco, 113 F. \nSupp. 3d at 38). \n31 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 31 of 80 \nThe government\'s focus on anticipated top-selling books also is consistent with cases in \nwhich courts have recognized the "high end" of other broad markets as distinct submarkets for \nantitrust purposes. See, e.g., Int\'! Boxing Club of NY., Inc. v. United States, 358 U.S. 242,251 \n(1959) (affirming district court\'s conclusion "that nonchampionship fights are not \'reasonably \ninterchangeable for the same purpose\' as championship contests" and explaining that defining \nthe relevant market "involves distinction in degree as well as distinctions in kind"); Whole \nFoods, 548 F.3d at 1032 (recognizing relevant submarket of "premium, natural, and organic \nsupermarkets" that "generally target affluent and well educated customers"); 0 \'Bannon v. Nat \'l \nCollegiate Athletic Ass \'n, 7 F. Supp. 3d 955, 986-88 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (recognizing relevant \nsubmarket of "elite football and basketball recruits"), rev \'din part on other grounds, 802 F .3d \n1049 (9th Cir. 2015). Thus, the relevant market defined here falls comfortably within the \nparameters set by numerous applicable precedents. \nThe defendants nevertheless fault the government for defining its submarket by "price \nalone," contending that any correlation between advance level and expected sales shows only \nthat books "are valued along a continuum." See Defs. PCOL ¶¶ 12, 24-25 ( emphasis in \noriginal). They argue that the existence of "a spectrum of price or value" is insufficient to \nestablish a submarket and, accordingly, that the government\'s market is not appropriately \ndefined. Id. 18 Once again, such arguments overlook the purpose of the $250,000 threshold as an \n18 \nIn support, the defendants primarily rely on In re Super Premium Ice Cream Distribution Antitrust Litig., \n691 F. Supp. 1262 (N.D. Cal. 1988), aff\'d sub nom. Haagen-Dazs Co. v. Double Rainbow Gourmet Ice Creams, \nInc., 895 F.2d 1417 (9th Cir. 1990), and United States v. Oracle C01p., 331 F. Supp. 2d 1098 (N.D. Cal. 2004). The \nCourt finds both In re Super Premium Ice Cream and Oracle inapposite. Neither case concerns a market of targeted \nsellers or buyers, as relevant to this case. Further, in In re Super Premium Ice Cream, the evidence showed that \nconsumers who bought higher-priced "super premium" ice cream could and would buy lower-quality ice cream as a \nsubstitute. See 691 F. Supp. at 1268. Here, authors of anticipated top-selling books have no alternative to selling \ntheir books to a publisher because, as addressed in Section I.C, self-publishing is not a realistic alternative. Because \nthey have no reasonable substitute, authors can be targeted for and impacted by a decrease in prices, in a manner that \nice-cream customers could not have been targeted by a price increase. As for Oracle, there, the government \n32 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 32 of 80 \nThe \nanalytical tool that facilitates the examination of market shares and anticompetitive effects. \nthreshold number need not represent an exact point at which the market begins to distinguish a \nproduct. See Wilhelmsen, 341 F. Supp. 3d at 54-55; Anthem, Inc., 236 F. Supp. 3d at 200 \n(accepting a 5,000-employee threshold to define "national accounts" even though the "threshold \nmay exclude some products that would meet the needs of smaller employers"); Staples II, 190 F. \nSupp. 3d at 118 & n.10 ("[T]here is no \'magic place that\'s the right place\' to draw the line." \n(quoting government expert\'s testimony)). Rather, a threshold will necessarily represent a \n"starting point" for "statistical estimates, the non-statistical implications of which support the \nappropriateness of regarding" anticipated top-selling authors as a "distinct [seller] group" that \nbuyers can target. Wilhelmsen, 341 F. Supp. 3d at 55. \nii. The Remaining Brown Shoe Factors \nAside from distinct pricing, the government argues that the remaining Brown Shoe \nfactors demonstrate that there is a relevant submarket for the publishing rights to anticipated top\xad\nselling books. See Govt. PFOF-PCOL ¶¶ 87-114, 117-121. The government contends that such \nbooks have "peculiar characteristics and uses," in that they require stronger marketing, publicity, \nand sales support, which allow them to reach a broader audience of readers. Id. ¶¶ 87 ( quoting \nBrown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325), 93-95. In addition, authors of anticipated top-selling books are \n"distinct sellers," in that they (1) care more about their publishers\' reputation and services, which \nensure wider distribution of their books; (2) may receive more favorable contract terms than \nother authors; and (3) face different competitive conditions, as demonstrated by the dominant \n$500,000 \nattempted to define a market of "high function" software and tried to use a minimum sale price of \nto \nidentify such software. See 331 F. Supp. 2d at 1158. Yet there were several flaws in the data analyzed and \npresented by the government\'s expert. See id at 1158-59. Nor did the government offer any other qualitative or \nevidence to define the market. See id Here, Dr. Hill\'s data suffers from no similar flaws and the \nquantitative \ngovernment has marshalled evidence beyond the advance price to show practical indicia of a submarket for the \npublishing rights to anticipated top-selling books. \n33 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 33 of 80 \nmarket share of the Big Five (91 %) in publishing anticipated top sellers. See id. \n66, 93-114, \n117-119. For all those reasons, the government argues, anticipated top-selling books are in a \ndifferent category from books that are expected to sell relatively few copies, and publishers can \ntarget their authors for price decreases. \nThe defendants, however, insist that all books are in the same market. They argue that \nbooks at all advance levels go through an identical editing, marketing, and distribution process; \nthat there is no difference in the personnel who handle such books; that the contracts for all \nbooks are negotiated in the same way; and that any special terms in the contracts for some books \nsimply result from an agent\'s leverage. See Defs. PFOF ¶¶ 47-67; Defs. PCOL ¶ 21. Further, \nthey contend that publishers cannot predict which books will be top sellers. See Defs. PFOF ¶¶ \n78 ("[P]ublishers generally have no objective criteria for reaching in advance a consensus on \nwhether a book is likely to be a top selling book."), 79 (arguing that publishers "cannot easily \npredict top sellers," other than books by celebrity, franchise, or prize-winning authors), 75 \n(asserting that every book is individual and author atypical) (citing Trial Tr. at 1068:12-13 \n(Weisberg), 1952:20-25 (Duhigg)); Defs. PCOL ¶ 21. \nThe Court has no trouble recognizing that anticipated top-selling books are distinct from \nthe vast majority of books that do not carry the same expectations for success. Obviously, the \nentire publishing industry is dedicated to selling books; and all editors and publishers naturally \nare very focused on discovering and acquiring the books that they believe will drive sales. \nEvidence strongly supports the conclusion that, from the perspective of editors and publishers, \nnot all books are created equal. Beyond advances, contracts for books that are expected to sell \nwell are more likely to include favorable terms like higher royalty rates, higher levels of \nmarketing support, "glam" packages (e.g., for hair, makeup, and wardrobe services), and airfare \n34 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 34 of 80 \nfor authors. 19 See Trial Tr. at 988:2-8 (Dohle) ("Very rarely, if ever, will I negotiate the other \nroyalty rates, but if it were to happen, it would be at that very, very top tier advance level."), \n1132:17-23 (Weisberg) ("top end" authors can negotiate terms such as payment schedules, \nbonuses, and glam budgets), 1819: 9-1820 :2 (Walsh) ( customization of contract terms is \ngenerally correlated with higher advances), 1828: 8-18 (Walsh) (higher marketing commitments \nare expected for higher advance books); DX 21 at 5 (agent demanding "a publisher ready to \ncommit incredible energy and resources"). Publishers print more of the books they think will do \nwell; circulate more advance copies of such books to reviewers or influencers to create \nexcitement; push for interviews with more media outlets; and schedule book-tour appearances in \nmore locations. 20 See Trial Tr. at 1373:12-1374:3 (Murray); PX 986. Anticipated top-selling \nbooks also get more attention from marketing and sales teams. 21 For example, Dr. Hill \ndetermined that S&S and PRH spend, on average, under $10,000 on marketing for books with \nadvances under $250,000, and between $40,000 and $90,000 on marketing for books with \nadvances over $250,000: \n19 \nFor example, Crown, a former publishing division of PRH that later merged with the Random House \ndivision, produced guidelines for marketing support based on expected sales and advance levels. See PX 986; Trial \nTr. at 2275:19-2278:1 (McIntosh). Under those guidelines, books with expected sales of more than 25,000 units or \nadvances of more than $150,000 were to receive a dedicated publicist, book tours with stops in 5 to 15 markets, \nextensive national media engagement, prominent placement on PRH and partner websites, and targeted social media \npushes. See PX 986 at 2-4. By contrast, books with advances and sales under those thresholds were to have only a \ncontact in the publicity department, smaller book tours (if any), and limited media engagement. See id at 5-9. \n20 \nSome of the defendants\' witnesses testified that all books are anticipated to sell well. See Trial Tr. at \n576:17-24 ("[A] good editor worries about every book that he or she acquires, making every book profitable."), \n1810:17-1812:4 (Walsh) ("I would say I always anticipate that what I am working on is going to be a best seller."). \nThat assertion is not credible. Although an agent, author, or publisher may "hope" every book will be a hit, that is \nnot the same as anticipating or expecting that a book will do well. See id at 1813 :4-6 (The Court: "You don\'t \nexpect every single book you work on to be a best seller or top seller?" Walsh: "Right. I hope."); see also id at \n328:2-10 (King) (explaining that he chose a smaller publisher for a book that "wasn\'t a crafted best seller"), \n593:21-594:8 (Karp) (recognizing that some books are "midlist" books that publishers are "hoping," but not \nanticipating, will be hits). \n21 \nSee Trial Tr. at 258:14-21 (Pande) ("I would say that there\'s a pretty clear relationship between the level of \nthe advance and the amount of resources that the publisher invests in the marketing and publicity of the book."), \n490:13-492:4 (Karp) ("[T]he big obvious books that we spent a lot of money for, they definitely have to be \nmarketed and publicized aggressively."), 1373:1-11 (Murray), 2001:12-2002:4 (Kim); PX 989 (Putnam post\xad\npublication P&L sheet) (showing general correlation between advance level and marketing spending). \n35 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 35 of 80 \n$100,000 \n$90,000 \n$80,000 \n$70,000 \n$60,000 \n$SO,OOO \n$40,000 \n$30,000 \n$20,000 \n$10,000 \n$0 \n0 -$250K \n$2SOK $SOOK \n$SOOK $?SOK \n$750K-$1M \nAdvance bins \nSee PX 972. \nThe fact that the Big Five publish 91 percent of anticipated top sellers also supports a \nfinding that the authors of such books have unique needs and preferences. See PX 963. \nAlthough smaller publishers can sometimes put out an anticipated top-selling  book, it is the Big \nFive who have the back lists and the marketing, publicity, and sales advantages necessary to \nconsistently provide the high advances and unique services that top-selling authors need. See \nsupra Section I.C (discussing Big Five\'s publishing advantages). It is precisely those specialized \nneeds that make the authors of anticipated top-selling books vulnerable to targeting for price \nreductions. Publishers of anticipated top-selling books know that such authors are not able to \nfind adequate substitutes for publishing their books because of their unique needs and \npreferences. See id. Those publishers therefore can target authors of anticipated top-selling \nbooks for a decrease in advances (prices) because it is not as likely that such a price decrease will \ncause the publishers to lose a book. See Wilhelmsen, 341 F. Supp. 3d at 56-57 (finding targeted \nbuyer market where market was characterized by individual negotiations and customers had \nunique needs and preferences); Staples II, 190 F. Supp. 3d at 127 (finding targeted buyer market \nwhere industry recognized customers as a distinct group that needed specific prices and \nservices); see also Merger Guidelines§ 4.1.4. \n36 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 36 of 80 \nAlthough the defendants proclaim that no one in the industry uses the term "anticipated \ntop seller," Defs. PFOF ¶¶ 87-88, that does not mean that such books do not exist. See \nWilhelmsen, 341 F. Supp. 3d at 51-52 (rejecting defendant\'s argument "that the definition of \nGlobal Fleets does not accord with commercial reality, given that [defendants do not] use the \nFTC\'s definition of that term .... "); see also Lev. Zujfa, LLC, 216 F. Supp. 3d 1154, 1159, \n1165-66 (D. Nev. 2016) (denying motion to dismiss that was based in part on defendant\'s \nargument that "Elite Professional MMA fighters" is not a term used in the industry). In fact, \nmarket participants have other names for expected top sellers, such as "lead titles" or "priority \ntitles."22 Regardless of nomenclature, clear evidence demonstrates that the practice of \nidentifying and giving special support to the books that will drive sales is common. The \ngovernment\'s defined market thus reflects "commercial realities" in the. publishing industry. \nUnited States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 572 (1966). \nThe defendants\' position that individual publishers are unable to anticipate which books \nwill be top sellers is unsupportable. That contention is contradicted by the universal industry \npractice of making a sales estimate for every single book before offering an advance, and \ncredible testimony that there is often consensus among editors and publishers about which books \nwill be popular with readers. See supra Section I.C; Trial Tr. at 2108:14-24 (Wylie) ("But I \nthink there are recognizable qualities in -\nin books that people who have been in the business \n22 \n"Lead titles" or "priority titles" are expected to sell well and receive more significant marketing, publicity, \nand sales support. See PX 986 (Crown internal guidance identifying "lead titles" as books with a sales goal of \n75,000 units or advances of $500,000, and advising increased marketing, sales, and publicity support for those \ntitles); PX 2005 at 24-27; Trial Tr. at 1071:4-1072:15 (Weisberg) (defining lead title as "top of the list"), 1988:19-\n25 (Kim) ("So every season, we have two or three titles that we really designate as lead titles, titles that we feel we \nreally want the sales team to really love and read, books that we feel we want to put a lot of attention on and \nmarketing support for."). They also generally receive high advances. See Trial Tr. 1071:4-1072:15 (Weisberg) \n("[I]fwe spend a lot of money on a book and it\'s a book that everybody loves, it becomes a lead title."), 2268:9-\n2269:22 (McIntosh) ("[I]f we had a really high sales expectation at time of acquisition and then by the time we\'re \nready to publish the book, we still have a sales -\na high sales expectation, then it would seem logical to me that -\nthat there could be a high advance attached to that."). \n37 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 37 of 80 \nfor a long time would easily recognize."). The defendants\' high share of the book-acquisition \nmarket and their substantial profit margins strongly indicate that they are successfully choosing \nbooks that people want to read. See PX 994; Trial Tr. at 781 :3-5 (Dohle), 1492:2-3 (Hill). To \nbe sure, editors often offer a range of advances for any given book, and the defendants correctly \nnote that there are many examples of books that were unexpected best sellers, such as Stephen \nKing\'s Carrie, or Marie Kondo\'s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. See Defs. PFOF \n¶¶ 79, 81. But it is commonplace for multiple editors to gravitate to the same book, as evidenced \nby the routine occurrence of competitive auctions; and the defendants do not dispute that there is \na general correlation between author advances and book sales, see Trial Tr. at 749:4-22 (Dohle); \nPX 151 at 11. That is strong evidence that the book-acquisition process is not random. Indeed, \nwhenever a publisher submits a bid of $250,000 or more for a book, that publisher has \ndetermined that the book is likely to be a top seller and knows that the competitors for the book \nare likely to be limited to the Big Five. See Trial Tr. at 153:10-13 (Pietsch) (other Big Five \npublishers are Hachette\'s main competitors for books with advances over $250,000); PX 530 at 2 \n(Big Five publishers are S&S\'s "biggest competitors ... since they are the most likely to come \nup with high advance payments required .... "). These practical indicia in the publishing \nindustry strongly support the existence of the identified relevant market. \nOne high-end submarket case that the Court finds highly relevant is Syufy Enterprises v. \nAmerican Multicinema, Inc. In Syufy, the Ninth Circuit upheld a relevant submarket "for [the] \nexhibition of industry anticipated top-grossing motion pictures in the San Jose area." 793 F .2d at \n994. Anticipated blockbusters, the court explained, "are identifiable ... on the basis of such \ncriteria as national advertising support, longer playtimes, guaranteed rentals, famous stars, \ndirectors and producers, booking in first class theatres, and lucrative terms offered for the \n38 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 38 of 80 \npictures by exhibitors." Id. at 994-95. Those indicia are analogous to some of the features of \nanticipated top-selling books, such as: more substantial marketing, publicity, and sales support; \nauthors who are prominent or have a track record of success; and higher advances. Moreover, \nthe appellant in Syufy challenged the existence of the market for "anticipated top-grossing \nmotion pictures" by making arguments similar to those pressed by the defendants here, insisting \nthat the market was "ex post facto and ad hoc," that "all first run films are in substantial \ncompetition with each other," and that such films "possess no special characteristics that \ndifferentiate them from less successful films from an ex ante perspective." Id. at 994. This \nCourt joins the Ninth Circuit in rejecting such arguments. As discussed, distinctive \ncharacteristics set anticipated top-selling books apart from the rest of the pack. \nIn sum, this case demonstrates that "[ w ]hatever the market urged by the [government], \nthe other party can usually contend plausibly that something relevant was left out, that too much \nwas included, or that dividing lines between inclusion and exclusion were arbitrary." FTC v. \nTronox Ltd., 332 F. Supp. 3d 187,202 (D.D.C. 2018) (quoting 2B Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert \nHovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 530d (4th ed. 2014) [hereinafter Areeda, Antitrust Law]). Yet \n"[t]he Supreme Court has wisely recognized there is \'some artificiality\' in any boundaries, but \nthat \'such fuzziness\' is inherent in bounding any market." Id.

(quoting Times-Picayune Publ\'g Co. v. United \nStates, 345 U.S. 594, 611 (1953)). Market definition is more art than science, see RAG-Stiftung, \n436 F. Supp. 3d at 312-13, and it is critical to remember that the goal of the exercise is to enable \nand facilitate the examination of competitive effects.

In this Court\'s view, the government has easily cleared the \nbar. 23 \n2. Supply Substitution \nThe traditional way to define a relevant market in the monopsony context would be to \nexamine "the commonality and interchangeability of the buyers" of a certain good. Todd v. \nExxon Corp., 275 F.3d 191, 202 (2d Cir. 2001). Indeed, \'"the outer boundaries of a product \nmarket are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-elasticity of \n[supply] between the product[\'s buyers, in the case of monopsony,] and the substitutes for [such \nbuyers].\' Accordingly, the touchstone is [supply] substitution .... " See Wilhelmsen, 341 F. \nSupp. 3d at 45 (quoting Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325). \nTo test the proposed market boundaries, courts commonly tum to the "hypothetical \n[monopsonist] test." Sysco, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 38. The hypothetical monopsonist test "ensures \nthat markets are not defined too narrowly," on the theory that if the test identifies substitute \nbuyers for the product in question, such buyers should be included in the market. See Merger \nGuidelines § 4.1.1 ( describing hypothetical monopolist test). The hypothetical monopsonist test \nassumes that there is only one buyer in the proposed market and asks whether that hypothetical \nbuyer, freed from price regulation, "could profitably target a subset of [sellers] for price \n[decreases]." Sysco, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 3 8 ( quoting Merger Guidelines § 4.1.4 ). If such a \nhypothetical monopsonist could profitably impose what economists call a "small but significant \n23 \nTo define a market around a targeted seller, sellers must not only be identifiable by buyers for differential \npricing but also must be unable to engage in arbitrage or opportunistic re-selling. See Staples II, 190 F. Supp. 3d at \n117-118; Merger Guidelines§ 3. The foregoing discussion establishes that anticipated top-selling books are subject \nto differential pricing. Authors of those books also cannot realistically engage in arbitrage by selling their books to \na third party who would then sell the books to publishers for a better price. See Trial Tr. at 1230:7-23 (Hill). As Dr. \nHill testified, publishers would still need to read the book or proposal and value it in the same manner as if the book \nwere submitted directly by the author. See id \n40 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 40 of 80 \nand non-transitory [decrease] in price" of at least five percent in the proposed market, that \nindicates the existence of a relevant market. Id. at 33-34 ( quoting Merger Guidelines § 4.1.4 ). \nHere, the government includes all publishing firms in the market to acquire the \npublishing rights for anticipated top-selling books. See Govt. PFOF-PCOL ¶ 79. Applying \nJudge Mehta\'s explanation of the test to the instant facts, we arrive at the following analysis: \nIf enough [authors] are able to substitute away from [ selling their books to] \nthe hypothetical [publisher monopsonist] to another [way of distributing \ntheir books] and thereby make a [ decrease in advances] unprofitable, then \nthe relevant market cannot include only the [publisher monopsonist] and \nmust also include the substitute [ method of distribution]. On the other hand, \nif the hypothetical [publisher monopsonist] could profitably [lower \nadvances to authors] by a small amount, even with the loss of some \n[authors], then economists consider the [publishers] to constitute the \nrelevant market. \nmarkets \nSee Sysco, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 33; see also Merger Guidelines § 12 ("In defining relevant \nbuy-side cases], the Agencies focus on the alternatives available to sellers in the face of a \n[in \ndecrease in the price paid for by a hypothetical monopsonist. Market power on the buying side \nof the market is not a significant concern if suppliers have numerous attractive outlets for their \ngoods or services."). \nThe government\'s expert, Dr. Hill, estimated what "actual diversions" would be for the \ndefined market, i.e., the percentage of authors who would switch to self-publishing in the face of \na "small but significant and non-transitory [ de ]crease" in advances paid for anticipated top\xad\nselling books. He found that even if some small number of authors switched to self-publishing, \nit would be profitable for publishers to decrease advances -\nthat is, the defection of authors in \nresponse to the lowered advances would be far less than what would be necessary to make the \ndecrease unprofitable. See Trial Tr. at 1245:14-1246:9 (Hill). \n41 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 41 of 80 \nThe defendants do not dispute that the relevant market of "publishing rights to anticipated \ntop-selling books" passes the hypothetical monopsonist test. See Trial Tr. at 2897:18-2898:18 \n(Snyder). They instead argue that the test is inapposite here because it does not address the \nalleged arbitrariness of the $250,000 threshold for bounding the market, see id.; Defs. PFOF \n¶ 44; indeed, submarkets at all but the lowest advance thresholds should pass the hypothetical \nmonopsonist test because self-publishing generally is a poor substitute for the services of an \nestablished publisher. See Trial Tr. at 2898:8-18 (Snyder) ("[S]elf-publishing is not a relevant \nconstraint."); supra Section I.C (further detailing inadequacy of self-publishing). The \nincongruence of the hypothetical monopsonist test here is not surprising because it examines \nsubstitutes for the buyers in the market, while the government\'s proposed market is one of \n"targeted sellers": In this case, the test and the market-definition dispute are focusing on \ndifferent sides of the market. 24 Although the Court agrees that the hypothetical monopsonist test \nsheds no light on the contested issues in this case, it is sufficient to note for present purposes that \nthe test is a standard analytical tool in merger cases; and that it concededly supports the \ngovernment\'s definition of the relevant market. Defendant\'s other objections to the relevant \nmarket have been addressed supra. \n24 \nFor this reason, the defendants\' argument that the government has not defined the "narrowest market," as \nrequired by some case law, lacks merit. See Defs. PCOL ¶¶ 35-41 (citing Merger Guidelines§ 4.1.1; RAG-Stiftung, \n436 F. Supp. 3d at 292; Sysco, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 26-27; United States v. H & R Block, Inc., 833 F. Supp. 2d 36, \n58-60 (D.D.C. 2011); FTC v. Arch Coal, Inc., 329 F. Supp. 2d 109, 120 (D.D.C. 2004)). The cases relied upon by \ndefendants focus on defining the market by reference to demand substitution and applying the hypothetical \nthe \nmonopolist test, while the instant case concerns a market defined by targeted sellers as articulated by the Merger \nGuidelines. See Merger Guidelines § 4.1.4 ("If prices are negotiated individually with customers, the hypothetical \nmonopolist test may suggest relevant markets that are as narrow as individual customers .... Nonetheless, the \nAgencies often define markets for groups of targeted customers, i.e., by type of customer, rather than by individual \ncustomer. By so doing, the Agencies are able to rely on aggregated market shares that can be more helpful in \npredicting the competitive effects of the merger."). \n42 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 42 of 80 \nB. Prima Facie Case \n1. Market Concentration \nOnce the relevant market has been established, the next step is straightforward: "[T]he \ngovernment must show that the merger would produce \'a firm controlling an undue percentage \nshare of the relevant market, and would result in a significant increase in the concentration of \nfirms in that market."\' See Heinz, 246 F.3d at 715 (quoting Phi/a. Nat\'! Bank, 374 U.S. at 363 \n(alterations omitted)). Market concentration is fundamental to merger analysis. "That \ncompetition is likely to be greatest when there are many sellers, none of which has any \nsignificant market share, is common ground among most economists, and was undoubtedly a \npremise of congressional reasoning about the antimerger statute." Phi/a. Nat\'! Bank, 374 U.S. at \n363 (cleaned up); see also Heinz, 246 F.3d at 715 ("[W]here rivals are few, firms will be able to \ncoordinate their behavior, either by overt collusion or implicit understanding, in order to restrict \noutput and achieve profits above competitive levels." (cleaned up)). Thus, demonstrating post\xad\nmerger \'"undue"\' market concentration "establishes a \'presumption\' that the merger will \nsubstantially lessen competition." Heinz, 246 F.3d at 715 (first quoting Phi/a. Nat\'! Bank, 374 \nU.S. at 363; and then quoting Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 982). In Philadelphia National Bank, \nthe Supreme Court held that a significant change in concentration that results in a combined \nmarket share of at least 30 percent is sufficient to establish the legal presumption that a merger \nviolates Section 7. 374 U.S. at 331, 364 (merger to a 36% market share with the top four banks \ncontrolling a combined 78%); see also Hosp. Corp., 807 F.2d at 1384 (determining that FTC\'s \nfinding that transaction was unlawful was supported by substantial evidence where defendant\'s \nmarket share was raised from 14 % to 26% and the market share of the four largest firms from \n79% to 91 %); cf Heinz, 246 F.3d at 711, 715-17 (holding FTC established presumption through \n43 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 43 of 80 \nstatistics about the change in market concentration where defendants would have a combined \nmarket share of 32.8%). \nThe government s expert, Dr. Hill , calculated market shares based on a comprehensive \nset of data from more than sixty publishers. See Trial Tr. at 1251:12- 1252:3 (Hill). According \nto his calculations, the merging firms account for nearly half ( 49 percent) of the publishing \nmarket for anticipated top-selling hooks. and the newly constituted "Big Four that would \nemerge after the deal would control approximately 91 percent. Trial T1·. at 1254:3-6 (Hill). \nGovernment\'s Exhibit 959 graphically depicts the post-merger market shares: \n60% \n40% \nPenguin \nAll \n----\nThe second-largest market participant post-merger would be \nwith 24 percent of \nthe market, while  \nwould have 10 percent and 9 percent respectively.  \nSee PX 959. The non-Big Four would have the remaining 9 percent. See id. Dr. Hill also \n44 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 44 of 80 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP  Document 194  Filed 11/07/22  Page 45 of 80 \ncalculated market shares using different advance thresholds to bound the relevant market and \nfound similar results. See PX 960. The post-merger market shares undoubtedly portray a highly \nconcentrated market dominated by four main players, with the leading, merged company holding \nan "undue percentage share." The 49-percent share that the post-merger PRH would hold is far \nabove the levels deemed too high in other cases. See, e.g., Phila. Nat\'l Bank, 374 U.S. at 364 \n(36%); of Heinz, 246 F.3d at 711, 715-17 (32.8%). The substantial market share of the \nproposed combined entity justifies a strong presumption of anticompetitive effects. See Baker \nHughes, 908 F.2d at 991 ("The more compelling the prima facie case, the more evidence the \ndefendant must present to rebut it successfully."). Moreover, the high concentration must be \nconsidered in the context of an undeniable trend in consolidation in the publishing industry. See \nUnited States v. Pabst Brewing Co., 384 U.S. 546, 552-53 (1966) ("[A] trend toward \nconcentration in an industry, whatever its causes, is a highly relevant factor in deciding how \nsubstantial the anti-competitive effect of a merger may be."). \nThe post-merger market also would be unduly concentrated under the Herfindahl- \nHirschman Index ("HHI"), a measure commonly used to evaluate market concentration. See \nRAG-Stiftung, 436 F. Supp. 3d at 310 n.26 (explaining calculation of HHI). The HHI is a \nformula "used to estimate the competitiveness of the market on the basis of the number and size \nof the films." Areeda, Antitrust Law ¶ 930a. It provides a "short cut to establish a presumption \nof anticompetitive effect through statistics about the change in market concentration." AT&T, \nInc., 916 F.3d at 1032. "The HHI estimates market concentration by summing the squares of the \nmarket share of every firm in the market. ...... When one assesses the competitive impact of a \nmerger, the important numbers are (1) the post-merger HHI; and (2) the amount the merger \nincreases the HHI." Areeda, Antitrust Law ¶ 930a (emphasis in original). An increase in the \n45 \nindex above certain levels "establish[ es] the [government\'s] prima facie case that a merger is \nanti-competitive." Heinz, 246 F.3d at 716. Under the Merger Guidelines, if an acquisition (1) \nincreases the HHI of a relevant market by more than 200 points and (2) results in a post\xad\nacquisition HHI exceeding 2500, it is presumptively anticompetitive. See Merger Guidelines \n§ 5.3; see also Staples 11, 190 F. Supp. 3d at 128; H & R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 71-72 \n( enjoining transaction that would have given the combined firm only a 28.4 percent market share \nbecause the transaction would have resulted in an increase in the HHI of more than 200 and a \npost-acquisition HHI that would have exceeded 2500). Here, the post-merger HHI would be \n3,111, with an increase of 891, well above the thresholds required to trigger the presumption \n25 \nunder the Guidelines. Trial Tr. at 1256:24-1258:11 (Hill), 1259:4-12 (Hill).\nBased on the market-share analysis and the HHI analysis, the government has met its \nburden to establish that the proposed merger between PRH and S&S would produce "a firm \ncontrolling an undue percentage share of the relevant market, and [would] result[] in a significant \nincrease in the concentration of firms in that market." Phila. Nat\'! Bank, 374 U.S. at 363. That \nshowing alone is sufficient to establish a prima facie case. Heinz, 246 F.3d at 716 ("Sufficiently \nlarge HHI figures establish the FTC\'s prima facie case that a merger is anti-competitive." (citing \nBaker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 982-83 & n.3)). Notably, the defendants do not question the \naccuracy of Dr. Hill\'s market-share calculations, nor his application of the HHI. \nThe government further notes that the market shares reflect the actual competitive \ndynamics in the market. See Govt. PFOF-PCOL ¶¶ 135-97. Dr. Hill compiled several different \ndata sets to evaluate how frequently the merging parties compete against each other and against \n25 \nMoreover, post-merger HHis (and the post-merger increase) also are above the presumption thresholds if \nthe relevant market is defined using a variety of other advance cutoffs (e.g., $150,000, $350,000, $500,000, or $1 \nmillion). Trial Tr. at 1254:7-25 (Hill); see also PX 960. \n46 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 46 of 80 \nother publishers. As discussed in more detail below, see infra, Section II.B .2.i, the data tracks \nthe instances where the merging parties lost books to one another, and where they were "runners\xad\nup" to each other in book acquisitions. Dr. Hill\'s analysis of the data reveals that, as market \nshares would predict, the Big Five in fact dominate book acquisitions in the relevant market. \nConsistent with their market shares, when S&S loses a book, it most often loses to PRH; and \nwhen S&S wins a book, its most likely runner-up is PRH. See Trial Tr. at 1282:15-24 (Hill) \n(indicating that for books acquired by S&S, PRH was the runner-up approximately 60% of the \ntime); PX 970 (showing diversion ratios); see also Trial Tr. at 2927:17-2928:4 (Snyder) (PRH is \nalso the most frequent runner up to S&S according to Professor Snyder\'s data set). Moreover, an \nindependent deal tracker maintained by Hachette for acquisitions above $500,000 also depicts \nresults consistent with market shares: Roughly 90 to 95 percent of Hachette\'s losses in that \nadvance range were to other Big Five publishers. See PX 790 (tracking Hachette\' s losses to \nthese publishers); Trial Tr. at 191:16-194:24 (Pietsch). \nAlso significant is the stability of the market shares held by the primary market \nparticipants over time. Based on Dr. Hill\'s comprehensive data set, which included information \nfrom approximately 1,200 book contracts per year, the market shares of the Big Five in acquiring \nanticipated top-selling books has remained stable for the past three years. See PX 967. \nFurthermore, the Big Five\'s market shares versus the non-Big Five have also been consistent: \nThe data demonstrate that the aggregate market share of non-Big Five publishers has been \n"essentially flat." Trial Tr. at 1482:15-25. This stability suggests that more weight should be \nassigned to market shares, see Merger Guidelines § 5 .3 ("The Agencies give more weight to \nmarket concentration when market shares have been stable over time .... "), and thus reinforces \nthe presumption of anticompetitive effects based on market concentration. \n47 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 47 of 80 \n2. Other Evidence \nThe government does not rely solely on the high degree of market concentration that \nwould result from the merger, and the attendant presumption of anti-competitive harm; instead, \nthe government also "bolster[s] its prima facie case by offering additional evidence." \nWilhelmsen, 341 F. Supp. 3d at 59. The government presents evidence that (1) the merger will \ncause anticompetitive effects from the elimination of competition between PRH and S&S, and \n(2) the higher concentration in the post-merger market will increase the risk of coordinated \nanticompetitive conduct by the largest publishers. See Govt. PFOF-PCOL ¶¶ 135-97. \ni. Unilateral Effects \nMergers necessarily eliminate the competition between the merging companies. \nSee Heinz, 246 F.3d at 717. The government contends that PRH and S&S currently compete \n"fiercely" to publish anticipated top-selling books, and that eliminating direct competition \nbetween them is likely to harm authors. Govt. PFOF-PCOL ¶ 244. Indeed, "[c]ourts have \nrecognized that a merger that eliminates head-to-head competition between close competitors \ncan result in a substantial lessening of competition." Sysco, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 61; see also \nWilhelmsen, 341 F. Supp. 3d at 59. "Unilateral effects" are those that result directly from the \nelimination of competition between the merging parties. Anthem, 236 F. Supp. 3d at 216. As \nexplained by the Merger Guidelines, "[ a] merger can enhance market power simply by \neliminating competition between the merging parties. This effect can arise even if the merger \ncauses no changes in the way other firms behave." Merger Guidelines § 1. Unilateral effects \nmay be especially acute in a "highly concentrated market." Staples I, 970 F. Supp. at 1083. \n48 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 48 of 80 \na. Head-to-Head Competition \nThe analysis of unilateral effects focuses on how closely the merging firms currently \ncompete, in order to extrapolate the effects of eliminating that competition. See Merger \nGuidelines § 6.2. Evidence in the record demonstrates that PRH and S&S are close competitors \nfor anticipated top-selling books. Specifically, PRH is the publisher against which S&S \ncompetes the most frequently and to which S&S loses the most. See Trial Tr. at 595 :23-25 \n(Karp) (agreeing that PRH is the "publisher [S&S] bid[s] against the most"), 1280:17-1281 :17 \n(Hill) (reviewing win/loss data showing that S&S loses to PRH about 60% of the time). \nMeanwhile, S&S is a significant competitor to PRH, see id. at 2360:20-23 (McIntosh), 1275:25-\n1276:6 (Hill), and makes a particularly strong showing in biographies, memoirs, political \nnonfiction, and books about current events, see id.. at 454:23--455:3 (Karp), 455:8-11 (Karp); \nPX 326 at 2 ("S&S has political bestseller chops like no other right now."). \nThe government\'s expert, Dr. Hill, conducted a variety of economic analyses that assess \nhow closely PRH and S&S compete. Dr. Hill used four different methods to calculate "diversion \nratios," which measure head-to head competition between the merging parties by asking the \nfollowing question: If one merging party lowered advance levels, what percentage of its authors \nwould "divert" their business to the other merging party, as opposed to diverting to other firms in \nthe industry? A higher diversion ratio indicates that the merging parties are close competitors \nand that the merger is more likely to lead to harm. See Trial Tr. at 1274:2-12 (Hill); see also \nMerger Guidelines § 6.1. \nDr. Hill calculated diversion ratios based on: (1) diversion proportional to market shares, \nwhich is the largest data set; (2) win/loss data, which examines which publishers the merging \nparties lose to the most often; (3) runner-up data, which shows how often the other party was the \n49 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 49 of 80 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP  Document 194  Filed 11/07/22  Page 50 of 80 \n"runner-up" when one of the merging parties won an acquisition; and (4) minutes from the \nparties\' editorial meetings, which provide a window into how frequently one merging party bid \non a book and lost to the other party. Recognizing that each methodology has limitations, Dr. \nHill performed multiple tests "to get a holistic understanding of what diversion might look like." \nTrial Tr. at 1294:20-1295:4. All the methodologies employed by Dr. Hill pointed to the same \nconclusion: that PRH is S&S\'s closest competitor, and that S&S is a significant competitor to \nPRH. Specifically, Dr. Hill\'s diversion ratios indicate that if PRH lowered advances, between 19 \nand 27 percent of its authors would divert to S&S; and that if S&S lowered advances, between \n42 and 59 percent of its authors would divert to PRH. The government summarized the results \nof the four studies as follows: \nFigure 7. Summary of Dr. Hill\'s Diversion Estimates (PX: 70) \nType of Analysis \nDiversion from \nPRHtoS&S \nDiversion from \nS&StoPRH \nDiversion according to shar e \n19% \n42% \nWin/loss data \n19% \n59% \nRunner-up sh1dy \n27% \n59% \nEditorial minutes \n21% \n54% \nSee Govt. PFOF-PCOL \n274 (citing PX 970). \nThe defendants\' expert, Professor Snyder, calculated his own diversion ratios, using a \nless reliable data set assembled from the records of eighteen agents who responded to subpoenas \n("agency data").26 Although Professor Snyder\'s ratios were lower, he also found that PRH is \n26 \nProfessor Snyder\'s agency data is less comprehensive than Dr. Hill\'s data set. The eighteen literary \nagencies that provided information in response to subpoenas are only a subset of the agents in the industry. See \nTrial Tr. at 2657:7-25 (Snyder). Of the 973 contracts examined by Professor Snyder, from 2018 to 2021, only 360 \nearned advances per title of $250,000 or more. See id. Of those 360 contracts, Professor Snyder could not identify a \nclear runner-up in 61 instances. See Trial Tr. at 2658:12-15 (Snyder). The remaining pool of data, relatively small \nand unrepresentative as it was, see Trial Tr. at 1289:22-1292:12 (Hill), indicated thatPRH and S&S were the winner \n50 \nS&S\'s closest competitor. Professor Snyder determined that the diversion ratio from PRH to \nS&S is 20 percent, and the diversion ratio from S&S to PRH is 27 percent. Trial Tr. at 2927 :4-\n25 (Snyder). \nThe competition between PRH and S&S benefits authors by increasing advances paid for \ntheir books, and industry participants predict that the loss of that competition would be harmful \nto authors. Kensington\'s CEO, Steven Zacharius, testified, "I personally would expect that \n[advances] would go down since there will be less competition for those authors." PX 2000 at 3. \nMacmillan\'s CEO Don Weisberg testified, "My guess is less competition will ... long-term \nprobably bring the advance levels down." See Trial Tr. at 1085:3-24. Agent Ayesha Pande \ntestified, "I think overall [the merger] will limit the choice, the number of editors and imprints \nand publishing houses that would ... be a good home for my clients .... And I believe overall \nadvances for my clients would be suppressed." See id. at 295:3-16. 27 \nThe merger would cause an inarguable loss of competition from the elimination of \nsituations where PRH and S&S would have been the top two or the only two bidders for an \nanticipated top seller. Dr. Hill calculates that this should happen in approximately 12 percent of \nand runner-up in only 7 percent of the cases, while market shares would have predicted that they would be winner \nand runner-up in 12 percent of the cases. See Trial Tr. at 1588:7-19 (Hill), 2797:20-2798:6 (Snyder). Notably, \nProfessor Snyder\'s estimate of diversion from S&S to PRH is based on a sample of only 22 books over four years, \nthe smallest sample of all the data sets used to estimate diversion. Trial Tr. at 1291:15-1292:12 (Hill), 1707:20 \n1708:1 (Hill); PX 996 at 1. \n27 \nDefendants presented testimony to the contrary, suggesting that the lost competition between PRH and \nS&S would not harm authors or their advances; and that it instead might lead to an increase in advance levels. See \nDefs. PFOF ¶¶ 25-26 (suggesting that savings from the merger would allow the combined company to spend more \nmoney to acquire books, which in turn would force competitors to offer higher advances), 115-116 (stressing that \nPRH and competitors have no plans to lower advances). For example, S&S CEO Jonathan Karp testified that the \ncompany has no plans to decrease author advances or reduce title count post-merger, see Trial Tr. at 583:13-19; and \nPRH Head of Global Mergers & Acquisitions Manuel Sansigre did not consider the potential for reduced author \ncompensation when projecting the merger\'s efficiencies for PRH, see id at 2532:25-2533:12. In addition, \nHarperCollins CEO Brian Murray stated that his comp any  had not discussed author advances decreasing  due to the \nmerg er, see id at 1407:24-1408:12; and that \n, see id at 1447:3-19, 1452:9-14. The Court finds testimony that the merger \nwill have either no effect or positive effects on advances incredible. The Court instead credits the much stronger \nevidence that advances will decrease after the merger, based on the market-share data, economic analyses, and the \nmore credible testimony regarding market dynamics discussed supra. \n51 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 51 of 80 \nonly \nbook transactions based on market share, while Professor Snyder calculates that it happened \n6 to 7 percent of the time in his data set. See id. at 1588:7-19 (Hill), 2797:20-2798:6 (Snyder). \nThe government\'s evidence included 27 summaries of competitive episodes, over three and a \nhalf years, in which PRH and S&S drove up advances through direct, head-to-head competition. \nSee id. at 660:16-25 (Porro), 664:8-10 (Porro), 686:9-22 (Porro). For example, as the only two \nbidders for one book, PRH and S&S drove the advance offered from $6 million to $8 million. \nSee PX 958-B. As the last two bidders for another book, PRH and S&S drove the advance \noffered from $685,000 to $825,000. See PX 941-B. The loss of such head-to-head match-ups \nundoubtedly would harm the authors whose advances would have been bid up by the direct \ncompetition. See generally Merger Guidelines § 6.2. The defendants argue, however, that the \nincidence of harm would be too infrequent to be considered substantial. See Defs. PCOL ¶¶ 58-\n65. \nEven when the merging parties were not the top two bidders, S&S \'s participation \nstrengthened competition across all auction formats -\nround-robin, best-bid, and hybrid. \nHachette CEO Michael Pietsch testified that a larger number of bidders leads to "more upward \npressure" so that "in general ... the price paid at auction can increase because of the number of \nparticipants." See Trial Tr. at 181:7-11 (Pietsch). Dr. Hill confirmed that when a large number \nimprints participate in an auction, all of them understand that they need to be more aggressive in \ntheir bidding to prevail. See id. at 1268:2-8 (Hill) ("So this is a correlation between when you \nhave a large number of bidders, you may need to be more aggressive in your bidding.");28 see \n28 \nDr. Hill gave two examples that demonstrate how the number of bidders influences a publisher\'s bidding \nstrategy in best-bids auctions. In a 2019 best-bids auction for a young adult novel, an S&S editor wrote that, \nwere only three bidders, "I think we can be more guarded in our bidding." See Trial Tr. at 1267: 15-\nbecause there \neditor and I discussed \n22 (Hill). In a 2020 best-bids auction for a book by a musician, a PRH editor wrote, "Another \nbringing our offer significantly down yesterday based on the sense I got from the agent that she doesn\'t have many \ninterested bidders." See id. at 1267:23-1268:1 (Hill). \n52 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 52 of 80 \nalso Anthem, 236 F. Supp. 3d at 220-21 ("reducing the number of national carriers from four to \nthree is significant" because of its likely effect on bidding behavior). A higher number of \nbidders also increases the chances that an author will receive an "outlier" high bid. A book\'s \nperceived value may vary significantly among different editors and publishers, and an unusually \nhigh bid for a book is likelier when there are more bidders. See Trial Tr. at 601 :20-25 (Karp), \n1305:18-1306:3 (Hill), 2109:3-21 (Wylie). In one notable example, one bidder offered an \nadvance four times higher than the next closest bidder, reflecting the winner\'s unique view of the \nbook\'s potential. See id. at 2931:16-2933:19 (Snyder). The loss of S&S as an independent \nbidder would weaken bidding incentives and reduce the frequency of events like these. \nAs previously noted, competition among publishers influences advances even in \nindividual negotiations between an agent and one publisher. See supra Section LC. That is \nbecause publishers know that agents can shop the book to other publishers if the publisher\'s offer \nis not high enough. See id. Therefore, the loss of PRH as an outside competitor would weaken \nauthors\' leverage in one-on-one negotiations with S&S, and the loss of S&S as an outside \ncompetitor would weaken authors\' leverage in one-on-one negotiations with PRH. This \nconclusion is consistent with Dr. Hill\'s expert testimony, see Trial Tr. at 1270:13-1271 :18 (Hill), \nas well as the Merger Guidelines. See Merger Guidelines § 6.2 ("A merger between two \ncompeting [buyers] prevents [sellers] from playing those [buyers] off against each other in \nnegotiations."). \nFinally, the evidence suggests that the acquisition of S&S would reduce PRH\'s \nmotivation to compete for publishing rights. PRH CEO Markus Doble testified that there are \ntwo ways to increase market share in the industry: publish more successful books or acquire \nother companies that publish successful books. See Trial Tr. at 801:18-23. PRH has most \n53 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 53 of 80 \nrecently pursued a strategy of bidding more aggressively and acquiring more "big books" to \norganically increase its market share. See id. at 800:15-801 :3 (Dohle), 2259:5-20 (McIntosh). \nshare \nThe acquisition of S&S would give PRH an alternative means of increasing its market \nthat \nwould remove the pressure on PRH to acquire more books. See id. at 802:11-18 (Dohle). Thus, \naccomplishing its goal of increasing market share through the merger would cause PRH to bid \nless aggressively for books than it otherwise would. See id. (Q: "After this merger, Penguin \nRandom House will not have as strong a need to grow its share?" Dohle: "Yes."). \nb. Economic Models \nDr. Hill used economic models to attempt to quantify the expected harm to authors from \nthe merger. He conceded that the models are imprecise and do not perfectly reflect the way \nbooks are acquired in the publishing industry; but he performed the analyses to glean additional \ninformation about the likelihood of anticompetitive harm. See id. at 1653 :25-1654:9 (Hill). Dr. \ndecrease \nHill\'s primary model predicts that the merger would cause advances for PRH authors to \nby about 4 percent ( or $44,000); and would cause advances for S&S authors to decrease by 11.5 \npercent (or $105,000). See id. at 1312:10-20 (Hill); PX 964 at 1-2. Although the defendants \nchallenge the applicability of the models and some of the inputs used by Dr. Hill, they fail to \nconvince the Court that the models are worthless. The economic models generally corroborate \nthe other evidence in the record that author advances would decrease in the wake of the merger. \nDr. Hill primarily relied on a "second-score auction" model to quantify the merger\'s \npotential harm to authors. See id. at 1295:21-22 (Hill). The model assumed that all book rights \nare allocated using auctions, see id. at 1298:13-1302:19 (Hill); and it used a market-share input \nto estimate how often the merging parties would be the top two bidders in an auction, see id. at \n1305:9-17 (Hill). The model used an input of variable-profit margins to estimate the variation \n54 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 54 of 80 \namong the bids: Using higher variable-profit margins generally would cause the model to \npredict greater harm, i.e., a bigger decrease in advance level.29 See id. at 1305:18-1306:3 (Hill). \nTo measure the effect of the merger, the model looked at the instances when the merging parties \nwould be the top two bidders and then eliminated the second-highest bid, thereby making the \nthird-place bid the one that would set the amount of the advance ( on the theory that the winning \nbid would now only need to beat the third-place bid). See id. at 1303 :7-22 (Hill). \nThe defendants argue that Dr. Hill\'s second-score auction model is flawed because (1) it \ninaccurately assumes that all book transactions involve auctions, and (2) Dr. Hill used the wrong \n183 \ninput for variable-profit margins. See Defs. PFOF ¶ 215; Defs. PCOL ¶¶ 106-121; ECF No. \n(Defs. Objections to Govt. PFOF-PCOL) at 29-36. Although the defendants are correct that the \nmodel does not precisely reflect how book contracts are allocated among publishers, its exclusive \nreliance on auctions is a reasonable simplification. See Trial Tr. at 1296:16-21 (Hill) (explaining \nthe \nwhy he interprets the model more broadly). The market-share data captures the rate at which \nparties are winning book contracts -\nthrough negotiations, auctions or otherwise; and market \nshares also reasonably predict how often the merging parties would be the winner and runner-up. \nCompare PX 970, with Trial Tr. at 2927:8-25 (Snyder) (diversion according to share produces \ndiversion ratios broadly consistent with Dr. Hill\'s runner-up study and Professor Snyder\'s \nagency data). Moreover, as previously discussed, competition affects advance levels even in \none-on-one negotiations, so the model\'s use of auctions to simulate the result of negotiations has \nsome basis in market reality. Finally, similar or identical models have been used in other \nantitrust cases involving industries that feature negotiations. See Wilhelmsen, 341 F. Supp. 3d at \n64-65; Anthem, 236 F. Supp. 3d at 217-20; Sysco, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 24, 66-67 (noting that \n29 \nVariable-profit margin is equal to revenue minus variable costs. The metric does not account for, i.e., \nsubtract, fixed costs. See Trial Tr. at 1310:2-25 (Hill). \n55 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 55 of 80 \ncustomers were awarded contracts through "a request for proposal or bilateral negotiations"). \nThe Court understands that the second-score auction model provides only a rough approximation \nof expected harm but nevertheless finds it useful. As for Dr. Hill\'s allegedly mistaken inclusion \nof fixed costs in some of his variable-profit margins, that was the more conservative approach: \nIncluding the extra costs lowered the margins and reduced the model\'s prediction of harm. See \nTrial Tr. at 1311: 18-1312:6 (Hill). Although Professor Snyder also suggested that Dr. Hill \nshould have included fixed costs in all the variable-profit margins, see id. at 3027:5-3030:4 \n(Snyder), Dr. Hill explained that the model explicitly calls for the use of variable, not fixed, \ncosts. 30 \nIn response to Professor Snyder\'s criticism that the second-score auction model was a \npoor fit for the publishing industry, Dr. Hill also ran a series of models based on the "gross \nupward pricing pressure index" (GUPPI). See id. at 1315: 16-1316: 10 (Hill). The GUPPI \nmodels use diversion ratios and margins as inputs, with higher diversion ratios and higher \nmargins leading to a higher prediction of harm. See id. at 1318:2-7 (Hill); see also supra \nSection III.B.2.i.a (explaining diversion ratios). But the GUPPI models used by Dr. Hill are \nmore difficult for the defendants to challenge because those models were originally adopted by \nthe defendants\' own economists during the pre-complaint investigation of the instant merger. \nSee Trial Tr. at 1633: 15-23 (Hill). The GUPPI models also predict a reduction in author \nadvances due to the merger, across different auction formats and using various diversion ratios, \nincluding those calculated by Professor Snyder. The government summarized Dr. Hill\'s findings \nas follows: \n30 \nBoth the second-score auction model and the GUPPI models, discussed infra, are "explicit" that one should \nuse firms\' variable, not fixed, costs to implement the models. Trial Tr. at 3092:23-3093: 15 (Hill). This is because \nthe models assume that publishers ask whether the marginal profits of acquiring one more book exceed the marginal \ncosts.

Supp. 3d at 212; see also FTC v. Sanford Health, No. 1:17-, v-133, 2017 WL \n10810016, at *12-13 (D.N.D. Dec. 15, 2017), aff\'d., 926 F.3d 959 (8th Gir. 2019). \niii. Coordinated Effects \nAnother avenue for the government to prove competitive harm is by showing a likelihood \nof "coordinated effects," which occur when market participants mutually decrease competition in \nthe relevant market. AT&T, 310 F. Supp. 3d at 246 ("A proposed merger may violate Section 7 \nby enabling or encouraging post-merger coordinated interaction among firms in the relevant \nmarket that harms customers." (cleaned up)); see also Merger Guidelines§ 7 ("Coordinated \ninteraction involves conduct by multiple firms that is profitable for each of them only as a result \nof the accommodating reactions of the others."). Coordinated effects can arise from an express \nor implied agreement among competitors, see CCC Holdings, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 60; or from \n"parallel accommodating conduct" among competitors without a prior agreement, Merger \nGuidelines § 7. Parallel accommodating conduct involves "situations in which each rival\'s \nresponse to competitive moves made by others is individually rational, and not motivated by \n57 \nretaliation or deterrence nor intended to sustain an agreed-upon market outcome, but \nnevertheless emboldens price [decreases] and weakens competitive incentives to [raise advances] \nor offer [authors] better terms." Id. \nCoordinated effects are likelier in concentrated markets; indeed, the idea that \nconcentration tends to produce anticompetitive coordination is central to merger law. See Heinz, \n246 F.3d at 716 ("Merger law \'rests upon the theory that, where rivals are few, firms will be able \nto coordinate their behavior, either by overt collusion or implicit understanding, in order to \nrestrict output and achieve profits above competitive levels."\' (quoting FTC v. PPG Indus., 798 \nF.2d 1500, 1503 (D.C. Cir. 1986)). Therefore, when the government has shown that a merger \nwill substantially increase concentration in an already concentrated market -\nas it has done \nhere, see supra Section III.B.1 -\n"the burden is on the defendants to produce evidence of \n\'structural market barriers to collusion\' specific to this industry that would defeat the \'ordinary \npresumption of collusion\' that attaches to a merger in a highly concentrated market." H & R \nBlock, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 77 (quoting Heinz, 246 F.3d at 725). \nAs an initial matter, a history of collusion or attempted collusion is highly probative of \nlikely harm from a merger. See Hosp. Corp., 807 F.2d at 1388; see also FTC v. Elders Grain, \nInc., 868 F.2d 901, 906 (7th Cir. 1989) ("[A]n acquisition which reduces the number of \nsignificant sellers in a market already highly concentrated and prone to collusion by reason of its \nhistory and circumstances is unlawful in the absence of special circumstances."); H & R Block, \n833 F. Supp. 2d at 78; Tronox, 332 F. Supp. 3d at 208-210; Merger Guidelines§ 7.2. Thus, it is \nsignificant that in United States v. Apple, Inc., the Second Circuit upheld a finding that between \n2009 and 2019, all the "Big Six"31 publishers, except for Random House, participated in a \n31 \nThis was before Penguin Books and Random House merged, so there was a "Big Six" instead of a "Big \nFive." \n58 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 58 of 80 \n"horizontal conspiracy ... to raise e[-]book prices." See 791 F.3d at 339. This coordination \ninvolved "numerous exchanges between executives at different Big Six publishers," "constant \ncommunication" among the publishers "regarding their negotiations with both Apple and \nAmazon," and "frequent telephone calls among the Publisher Defendants." Id. at 302, 318. \n"[T]he Big Six operated in a close-knit industry and had no qualms communicating about the \nneed to act together." Id. at 300. The Second Circuit concluded that the publishers engaged in \n"express collusion" that was a per se violation of antitrust law. Id. at 316, 321-29. Although \nRandom House did not participate in the conspiracy, Penguin Books and S&S both did, see id. at \n308, and this "history of successful cooperation establishes a precondition to effective collusion \n-\nmutual trust and forbearance." See Hosp. Corp., 807 F.2d at 1388. The case portrays an \nindustry already "prone to collusion," which may become "even more prone to collusion" after \nthe proposed merger of its largest and third-largest competitors. See Elders Grain, 868 F.2d at \n905-06. \nThe Apple case provides the backdrop for trends in the industry that appear to \ndemonstrate that the Big Five are already engaging in tacit collusion or parallel accommodating \nconduct when acquiring books. Recent years have seen the industry-wide standardization of \ncertain contract terms -\ninvolving payment structure, audio rights, and e-book royalties -\nin \nways that favor publishers over authors, suggesting that the top publishers have engaged in \ncoordinated conduct. Advances used to be paid to authors in two installments, but publishers \nuniformly moved to paying them in three installments and then four installments, thereby \ndelaying authors\' compensation. See supra Section LB. After audiobooks became a significant \nsource of revenue in the industry, publishers uniformly refused to acquire books without audio \nrights included, thereby limiting authors\' ability to maximize their compensation and preventing \n59 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 59 of 80 \nauthors from diversifying their sources of income. See id. In addition, during the early years of \ne-books, publishers uniformly shifted e-book royalty rates from 50 percent to 25 percent, thereby \nreducing authors\' compensation. See Trial Tr. at 774:6-776:21 (Dohle). Thus, in an industry \nwhere the competition to acquire anticipated top sellers is intense, the competing publishers \nnevertheless choose, almost always, not to gain advantage by offering more favorable contract \nterms. This phenomenon bespeaks a tacit agreement among the publishers to compete only on \nthe basis of advance level because it collectively benefits them not to yield on other contract \nterms. Accord H & R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 77-78 ("[A] highly persuasive historical act of \ncooperation between [competitors]" supports the theory that "coordination would likely take the \nform of mutual recognition that neither firm has an interest in an overall \'race to free\' .... "). \nOne example involving audio rights is illustrative. When selling the publishing rights to \n-\nhighly sought-after book, her agent attempted to hold an auction that excluded audio \nrights. S&S wanted the book but refused to bid because "[t]he only way to prevent agents from \nbreaking off audio rights like this is to hold firm to our policy of no deals without audio rights." \nPX 652 at 2. An S&S editor ruminated, "It will be very interesting to see whether PRH, \nHachette, Harper or Macmillan participate. M[y] understanding is that they too have the \'no \naudio, no deal\' rule." Id. The agent was forced to restart the auction with audio rights included, \nsee PX 568 at 3, presumably because the book received insufficient offers or only received offers \nthat included audio. See PX 320 at 1 (in the first round, PRH bid for bundled audio rights in \nviolation of the auction\'s initial rules). In the renewed auction that included audio rights, the \nbidding was fervid and reflected vigorous competition. 32 This episode starkly demonstrates that \n32 \nAs previously discussed, there were six rounds of bidding between four bidders, with a high bid of \n$400,000 in the first round and a winning bid of $775,000 from PRH\'s Viking imprint, which was $75,000 more \nthan Viking\'s initial bid clearance. See supra Section I.C. \n60 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 60 of 80 \nthe publishers, despite their great enthusiasm for the book, initially engaged in parallel conduct \nto deny the author the ability to exclude audio rights from the auction. The parallel conduct was \neffective and mutually beneficial, as the publishers all retained the opportunity to acquire the \nbook, with their preferred contract term concerning audio rights. Based on this evidence, the \nCourt finds that the Big Five publishers have engaged in tacit coordination that is profitable for \nthose involved. \nFinally, it is significant that in a market already prone to collusion, where coordinated \nconduct already appears to be rampant, PRH\' s acquisition of S&S would reinforce the market\'s \noligopsonistic structure and create a behemoth industry leader that other market participants \ncould easily follow. See PX 80E (translation of PX 80, materials for Bertelsmann board \npresentation) at 13 ( describing publishing industry as an oligopoly). The Big Five publishers \nalready control 91 percent of the relevant market. See PX 963. The merger would distill the Big \nFive to a Big Four, with an overwhelmingly dominant top firm, PRH-S&S, controlling 49 \npercent of the market and dwarfing its nearest competitors. In the newly reconfigured market, \nthe top two firms, the merged entity and  \nwould have a 74-percent market share. \nSee id. Under such circumstances, coordinated effects are likely through "sheer market power" \nbecause the "post-merger market would feature two firms that control roughly three quarters" of \nthe market. Tronox, 332 F. Supp. 3d at 209; see also Heinz, 246 F.3d at 724 n.23 (recognizing \nthat "price leadership" is "a danger" in a "duopoly" market). The merger would thus increase \nthe market\'s already high susceptibility to coordination. See Trial Tr. at 1329:18-21 (Hill). 33 \n33 \nOther factors that courts have found relevant to an evaluation of the likelihood of coordinated effects \ninclude: differentiated products, transparent competitive outcomes, punishment mechanisms, and frequent purchases \nfor small amounts. See H & R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 77-79; CCC Holdings, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 62; Arch Coal, \n329 F. Supp. 2d at 144-45 . The Court sees no need to march through a discussion of those factors. Merger analysis \nis industry-specific and fact-intensive. See Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 321-22 ("Congress indicated plainly that a \nmerger had to be functionally viewed, in the context of its particular industry." (footnote omitted)). Where, as here, \n61 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 61 of 80 \nC. Rebuttal \nThe government is entitled to a presumption of anticompetitive effects and has also met \nits burden to establish a prima facie case. The defendants, therefore, now have the burden to \nrebut the government\'s case by "show[ing] that the prima facie case inaccurately predicts the \nrelevant transaction\'s probable effect on future competition." See Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at \n981. It is the defendants\' task to demonstrate that the market shares and the associated \npresumption of illegality inaccurately reflect competitive reality. See id.; see also Heinz, 246 \nF.3d at 715 ("To rebut the presumption, the defendants must produce evidence that shows that \nthe market-share statistics give an inaccurate account of the merger\'s probable effects on \ncompetition in the relevant market." ( cleaned up)). \n"There is no science to weighing the factors at play in an antitrust analysis," and the \ndefendants may rebut the government\'s prima facie case with any relevant "real-world \nevidence." RAG-Stiftung, 436 F. Supp. 3d at 312. For example, the defendants may meet their \nburden of rebuttal by demonstrating low barriers to entry in the relevant market, see, e.g., \nWilhelmsen, 341 F. Supp. 3d at 68; Staples II, 190 F. Supp. 3d at 133; or sophisticated \ncounterparts (here, authors and agents) who can blunt the impact of consolidation, see, e.g., \nRAG-Stiftung, 436 F. Supp. 3d at 315. \n"[B]ecause the burden of persuasion ultimately lies with the plaintiff, the burden to rebut \nmust not be \'unduly onerous."\' United States v. Anthem, Inc. ("Anthem II\'), 855 F.3d 345,350 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 981, 991). However, "[t]he more \ncompelling the prima facie case, the more evidence the defendant must present to rebut it \nthere is a strong risk of collusion based on history, current practices, and extreme market concentration, the Court \nfinds it unnecessary to explore peripheral issues. \n \n62 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 62 of 80 \nsuccessfully." See Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 991. Here, the government has "made out a \nstrong prima facie case" based on the highly concentrated market and affirmative evidence of \nlikely anticompetitive effects. See Wilhelmsen, 341 F. Supp. 3d at 66. The defendants, \ntherefore, "must make out a correspondingly strong rebuttal showing." See id. \n1. Existing Competition \nThe defendants assert that existing competition can and will constrain the merged \ncompany more than market shares or the government\'s evidence would suggest. See, e.g., Sysco, \n113 F. Supp. 3d at 78. The defendants point to competition from other publishers, competition \nfrom self-publishing, and internal competition within publishing houses. See Defs. PFOF \n¶¶ 115-23, 164-85, 198-213; Defs. PCOL ¶¶ 74-79. \ni. Other Publishers \nThe defendants argue that a combined PRH and S&S would be constrained by other \npublishers, who do not plan to lower their advance offers or change their bidding strategies. See \nDefs. PFOF ¶¶ 115-23; Defs. PCOL ¶¶ 74-76. For example, HarperCollins\'s CEO Brian \nMurray testified that his company would not "hold back" in competing with the merged entity. \nSee Trial Tr. at 1385:9-15 (Murray). Consistent with that testimony, HarperCollins did not \nproject a decrease in its title count or its advance spending after the PRH-S&S merger was \nannounced. See DX 279 (HarperCollins strategy presentation for 2022) at 25. The CEOs of \nother competitors, including Hachette and \n also stated that they would not change \ntheir bidding strategies in response to the merger. See Trial Tr. at 211 :9-13 (Hachette CEO \nMichael Pietsch); \n) at 31. Therefore, the defendants \nargue, other existing publishers stand ready to prevent any unilateral anticompetitive effects from \nthe merger. \n63 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 63 of 80 \nThe defendants\' reliance on such assurances from their competitors is insufficient. It is \nnot necessary for other publishers to change their maximum advances or bidding strategies for \nanticompetitive unilateral effects to occur. First, and most obviously, with respect to book \nacquisitions where PRH and S&S would have been the winner and runner-up, the merged entity \nwill acquire such books for lower advances regardless of the other publishers\' bids. See supra \nSection III.BJ, Section III.B.2.i. \nSecond, in situations where PRH or S&S would have won a book, regardless of the \nrunner-up, the merged entity might submit a lower bid due to its decreased motivation to achieve \norganic growth. See supra Section III.B .2. In such a case, another publisher could win the book \ninstead, for a lower advance than what PRH or S&S would have offered as standalone entities. \nThird, publishers do not immediately offer their maximum advance when attempting to \nacquire books; moreover, they initially offer higher advances when they think there is more \ncompetition, and lower advances if they think there is less competition. See supra Section \nIII.B.2.i.a; see also Trial Tr. at 499:6-500:12 (Karp), 1267:13-1268:8 (Hill). The general \nsoftening of competition with the elimination of S&S as a standalone bidder, leading to the \nperception of less competition in book acquisitions, would likely lead publishers to make lower \ninitial advance offers. See supra Section III.B.2. If subsequent bids that would have come from \nPRH or S&S as separate entities are not forthcoming, or are lower than they otherwise would \nhave been, the other publishers could acquire books for lower advances simply by following \ntheir existing bidding strategy. \nFourth and finally, it is not necessary for advances to decline in absolute terms for \nauthors to be harmed. The relevant market has been growing rapidly in recent years in response \nto strong consumer demand, and advances have been rising, consistent with that growth. See PX \n64 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 64 of 80 \n2002 (Stehlik) at 16-17; DX 422 (Glusman) at 37-38; Trial Tr. at 991:5-19 (Tart), 1990:4-9 \n(Kim). If the merger goes through, the rate of growth might be offset by competitive harm, \nallowing publishers to acquire books for more than they do now but for less than they would \nhave absent the merger. That would result in harm to authors even if there were no decline in \nadvances, or even if there was some (slowed) growth in the total advances paid. \nThe defendants also argue that non-Big Five publishers would be a significant \ncompetitive constraint on a combined PRH and S&S. See Defs. PFOF ¶¶ 164-80; Defs. PCOL \n¶¶ 74-76. The evidence shows, however, that the smaller publishers lack the resources to \ncompete regularly in the market for anticipated top-selling books. See supra Section I.C; Trial \nTr. at 2047:13-18 (Cheney). Individual publishers outside the Big Five rarely acquire books for \nadvances at or above $250,000. See PX 963. \nThe defendants take the novel approach of aggregating all the non-Big Five publishers \nand characterizing them as a single force with a 9-percent market share -\nwhich allegedly \nmakes their collective power to constrain the merged company comparable to that of a Big Five \npublisher. See Defs. PFOF ¶ 164 ("When aggregated, the non-Big-Five publishers are as likely \nto win as \n.... "); Defs. PCOL ¶ 64 (arguing that an "effective 6-5 merger \n(based on market shares) [is] at issue here"); see also Trial Tr. at 2906:10-2907:14 (Snyder). 34 \nThe defendants offer no precedent to support this economic sleight of hand, and the methodology \nappears dubious. If market shares can be so readily manipulated by aggregating unaffiliated \ncompanies, why not aggregate all the publishers that are not PRH and S&S into a single, massive \ncounterweight with a 51 percent market share? The defendants\' approach appears incompatible \nwith the way antitrust law approaches market concentration and its presumed effects on \n34 \nAlthough Dr. Hill combined the non-Big Five\'s market shares in his economic models as a reasonable \nsimplification, see Trial Tr. at 3081: 12-23 (Hill), he did not treat them as one competitor in his overall analysis. \n65 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 65 of 80 \ncompetition. See supra Section III.B .1. Generally, a firm with lower market share is assumed to \nwield less market power, and market concentration would be considered low in an industry with \nmany individual firms with small market shares. See Merger Guidelines § 5 .3 ("The Agencies \nmay measure market concentration using the number of significant competitors in the market. \nThis measure is most useful when there is a gap in market share between significant competitors \nand smaller rivals .... "). For example, applying a HHI analysis shows that 100 firms that each \nhave a I-percent market share (which would produce an HHI of 100) do not represent the same \ncompetitive landscape as two firms that each have a SO-percent market share (which would \nproduce an HHI of 5000). 35 Indeed, the government points out that aggregating the non-Big \nFive publishers does not help the defendants\' case because it yields a higher HHI and depicts a \nmore concentrated market. See Govt. PFOF-PCOL ¶ 134. \nProfessor Snyder gave counterintuitive and apparently erroneous testimony about the \nsignificance of non-Big Five bidders in competitive auctions. He claimed that the non-Big Five \npublishers, with a combined market share of 9 percent, are nevertheless the winner or runner-up \nin 23 percent of auctions for anticipated top-selling books; while PRH and S&S, with a \ncombined market share of 49 percent, are the winner and runner-up only seven percent of the \ntime. See Trial Tr. at 2689:22-2690:5 (Snyder), 2827:13-23 (Snyder). The Court finds the 23-\npercent figure unreliable because it was the subject of much contradictory testimony at trial, \nincluding the credible assertion by Dr. Hill that the number should be halved. See id. at \n3051 :16-3053:17 (Hill). And overall, Professor Snyder\'s reliance on the limited and \nunrepresentative "agency data" weakened the credibility of his analyses. See supra Section \n35 \nSumming the squares of each firm\'s market share, the first HHI is calculated as 100 x 12 = 100, and the \nsecond HHI is calculated as 2 x 502 = 5000. See supra Section III.A.2. \n66 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 66 of 80 \nIII.B.2 (note 26). Thus, the defendants\' expert fails to cast doubt on the reliability of the market\xad\nshare statistics presented by the government. See Heinz, 246 F.3d at 715. \nii. Internal Competition \nThe defendants argue that internal imprint competition increases competition in the \nmarket beyond that represented in market shares. See Defs. PFOF ¶¶ 198-213; Defs. PCOL \n¶¶ 77-79. That argument is undermined by the presumption that "[c]ompanies with multiple \ndivisions must be viewed as a single actor, and each division will act to pursue the common \ninterests of the whole corporation." AT&T, 916 F.3d at 1043. This presumption "was adopted as \na principle of antitrust law," id., in Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. \n752, 771 (1984) ("[T]he coordinated activity of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary must be \nviewed as that of a single enterprise .... A parent and its wholly owned subsidiary have a \ncomplete unity of interest."). Consistent with economic principles and common sense, internal \nimprint competition should be considered only to the extent that it maximizes the profits of the \npublishing house. See Areeda, Antitrust Law ¶ 964b ("Antitrust law generally presumes that a \nfirm maximizes its profits in the environment in which it finds itself .... "). \nAlthough internal competition among imprints is currently permitted by some publishers \nin round-robin auctions, such competition is far from unrestrained. To the extent imprints \ncompete internally within the confines of a house bid, they can provide more editorial choices to \nauthors, but there is no price competition that allows authors to achieve the highest possible \nadvance level. See supra Section LC. Even this non-price competition is discouraged. See DX \n71 at 2 ( email from S&S CEO Karp regarding editor guidelines) ("Duplicating work is not a \nproductive expenditure of one of our most valuable resources -\ntime. You can acquire more \nbooks if you aren\'t all chasing the same ones .... Try to bail out on submission in which there \n67 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 67 of 80 \nare more than two imprints in the building pursuing the project."). In cases where internal \nimprints do compete financially, such competition is confined to situations where there is an \nexternal bidder. Moreover, as previously discussed, there are numerous examples in the record \nof PRH using "background coordination in auctions to ... avoid internal up-bidding." PX 411 at \n4; see also Trial Tr. 2372:17-2373:8 (McIntosh); supra Section LC. Thus, internal competition \nwould have a very limited impact in mitigating anticompetitive effects in the industry. To \nachieve the highest advances for authors, internal imprint competition is no substitute for \ncompetition among independent publishers. \nThe defendants assert that the merged company would go even farther in permitting \ninternal competition than current policies allow. See Defs. PFOF ¶ 210; DX 236. They note that \nPRH CEO Dohle has promised, in a letter to agents, that S&S legacy imprints will bid against \nPRH imprints even when there are no external bidders. See Defs. PFOF ¶ 210; DX 236. The \nCourt gives no weight to this unenforceable promise. Indeed, the promise calls to mind the \ncriminal-law concept of "consciousness of guilt": Mr. Dohle\'s extraordinary pledge appears to \nreflect his awareness of how threatening the combined entity would be to authors and agents. \nThe promise lacks credibility for three reasons: \nFirst, the proposed policy would not be profit-maximizing and is thus unreliable evidence \nof future conduct. See Areeda, Antitrust Law ¶ 964b. It is unclear how the new feature of the \npolicy -\nallowing internal competition even without an external bidder -\nwould financially \nbenefit the combined entity. Instead, it appears that the promise was made just to get the deal \ndone, and once the merger is executed, there will be no economic incentive to maintain the \npolicy. \n68 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 68 of 80 \nSecond, the promise can be broken at will. Mr. Dohle, his successor, or his superiors \ncould legally change or rescind the new policy at any time. The defendants argue that such \nbehavior would harm the merged entity because of backlash from agents, see Defs. PFOF ¶ 210, \nbut evidence shows that agents have limited power over the large publishing houses, see infra \nSection III.C.3.i. A unilateral promise by PRH that it will not use its market power if it acquires \nS&S cannot rebut the government\'s prima facie case. See H & R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 82 \n(Even if "the Court has no reason to doubt that defendants would honor their promise [to \nmaintain the acquired firm\'s current prices for three years post-merger], this type of guarantee \ncannot rebut a likelihood of anticompetitive effects in this case."). \nThird, the promise would not prevent the merged entity from reducing internal imprint \ncompetition. Despite the promise, PRH could coordinate bids with legacy S&S imprints in the \nsame way that PRH currently does among its own imprints. See supra Section LC. The promise \nalso would not stop the merged company from consolidating PRH and legacy S&S imprints, as \nPRH did when it reorganized the divisions within Random House in 2019, so that "there [ would] \nbe less internal competition with[in] the focused editorial profiles in [its] divisions." See \nPX 241. Finally, the merged entity could direct its imprints to focus on non-competing genres, \nthereby preventing the imprints from pursuing the same books. See id. For all the foregoing \nreasons, Mr. Dohle\'s promise does little to rebut the government\'s prima facie case or the \npresumption of anticompetitive effects. \n69 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 69 of 80 \niii. Self-Publishing \nThe defendants argue that self-publishing is a competitive constraint on the market, \nparticularly for celebrity and romance authors. 36 See Defs. PFOF ¶¶ 181-85; see also Trial Tr. at \n5 66: 1-11 (Karp). But, as previously discussed, self-publishing is not a reasonable substitute for \ntraditional publishers in the market for anticipated top-selling books. See supra Section I.C, \nSection II.A.2. Anecdotes about author Brandon Sanderson raising $40 million on Kickstarter, \nor author Colleen Hoover having success with self-publishing, do not change the overall picture \nof the industry. Sanderson\'s success with self-publishing was "rare," "a feat," and "so \nincredible." Trial Tr. at 1076:4-10 (Weisberg), 1077:4-7 (Weisberg). Similarly, Hoover is "a \ncultural phenomenon" and "the hottest author in the country." Id. at 524: 18-25 (Karp), 560:5-\n10 (Karp). Sanderson and Hoover are exceptions that prove the rule: For the overwhelming \nmajority of authors in the relevant market, self-publishing is no real substitute for using a \npublishing house, and self-publishing therefore does little to constrain anticompetitive effects. \n2. Barriers to Entry and Expansion \nThe defendants argue that there are few barriers to entry that would prevent new or \nexisting publishers from competing effectively with the merged company. See Defs. PFOF \n¶¶  69, 124-48; Defs. PCOL ¶¶ 80-83. New entrants to the market would presumably give \nauthors alternative outlets to publish their books, thereby preventing the merged entity from \nlowering advances. "The existence and significance of barriers to entry are frequently ... crucial \nconsiderations in a rebuttal analysis. In the absence of significant barriers, a company probably \ncannot maintain [sub]competitive pricing for any length of time." Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at \n36 \nDefendants admitted in their closing argument that self-publishing was not a true option for authors. See \n17-25 (arguing that hypothetical monopsonist test is "utterly meaningless other than addressing \nTrial Tr. at 3272: \nwhether there\'s an outside option in the form of self-publishing, which nobody was arguing in this case"). In their \npost-trial briefing, however, they surprisingly assert that self-publishing is a competitive threat. \n70 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 70 of 80 \nand \n987. To constrain the new entity, "entry [by new competitors] must be timely, likely, \nsufficient in its magnitude, character, and scope to deter or counteract the competitive effects of \nconcern." Wilhelmsen, 341 F. Supp. 3d at 66-67 (quotations omitted). "The expansion of \ncurrent competitors is regarded as essentially equivalent to new entry, and is therefore evaluated \naccording to the same criteria." Id. at 66 ( quotations omitted). \nContrary to the defendants\' contentions, the evidence demonstrates that there are \nsubstantial barriers to entry and expansion in the publishing market for anticipated top-selling \nbooks. Established publishers have many advantages that are not easily replicated, including: (1) \nback lists that generate substantial and consistent revenue, which in tum supports risky \nacquisitions of high-advance books, see Trial Tr. at 156:5-157:14 (Pietsch); (2) large and \neffective marketing, sales, and distribution teams that have relationships with media and \nretailers, see \nat 6-7; (3) excellent reputations and track records of success \nto \nthat attract authors, see Trial Tr. at 454:11-22 (Karp); and (4) lower variable costs due \neconomies of scale, see id. at 2047:16-18 (Cheney); see also Section LC. In addition, numerous \npublisher witnesses expressed concern about a lack of access to sufficient printing capacity, \nwhich limits the number of books that publishers can physically produce and thus limits \nopportunity for expansion. See id. at 758:3-5 (Dohle), 121:8-19 (Pietsch), 364:1-9 (Eulau); ■ \nat 3. Industry insiders, including PRH executives, \ncandidly acknowledged in trial testimony and ordinary-course documents that barriers to entry \nare high in the publishing business. See Trial Tr. at 168:9-169:1 (Pietsch), 755:4-15 (Dohle), \n1380:12-1381 :8 (Murray); PX 80-E at 13; PX 79 (presentation by PRH executives on publishing \nindustry) at 8. \n71 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 71 of 80 \nThe best proof that would-be new competitors face formidable barriers to entry is the \nstability of market shares in the industry: No publisher has entered the market and become a \nstrong competitor against the Big Five in the past thirty years. See Trial Tr. at 163 :2-6 (Pietsch). \nMoreover, the Big Five\'s market share in acquiring anticipated top-selling books has remained \nstable for the past three years. See PX 967. Thus, there is little evidence that new or existing \npublishers will grow at a pace and magnitude that would allow them to discipline a merged PRH \nand S&S. See Wilhelmsen, 341 F. Supp. 3d at 68 ("The fact that the merging parties have been \nable to maintain high margins and market shares without witnessing notable entry and expansion \nsuggests that ... the market ... is characterized by significant barriers to entry." ( cleaned up)); \nMerger Guidelines § 5 .3 ("The Agencies give more weight to market concentration when market \nshares have been stable over time .... "). The Big Five\'s market shares are built on "decades of \ncredibility and success," Trial Tr. at 454:11-22 (Karp), and they cannot be easily challenged by \nless-established publishers. \nAlthough the defendants argue that social media like "BookTok"37 and Amazon\'s online \nbookstore level the playing field for smaller publishers, those platforms are not new and are far \nfrom "game-changing." See id. at 1069: 1-4 (Weisberg) ("[T]his is the business of one-to-one \nword of mouth. It\'s never been anything else and it\'s still not, just the devices have changed."). \nDespite the current availability of "BookTok" and virtual storefronts, the Big Five still \nconsistently acquire the publishing rights for 91 percent of anticipated top-selling books, \ndemonstrating that the playing field has not been leveled in any meaningful way. See PX 994. \nFor example, PRH utilizes its superior resources to maximize sales even on Amazon. See supra \n37 \nBook:Tok refers to activity on the social media platform TikTok where users review and promote books to \none another. See Trial Tr. at 1414:12-16 (Weisberg). \n72 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 72 of 80 \nand \nSection LC (PRH hires data scientists to study Amazon\'s search algorithms \nspends money to \nget books better positioned in Amazon\'s search results.). \nand \nThe defendants nevertheless point to new entrants like Zando, Spiegel & Grau, \nAstra \nHouse, which have had some success in acquiring publishing rights to anticipated top-selling \nbooks. See Defs. PFOF ¶¶ 129-32, 144, 147. Although those publishing houses are associated \nwith successful and well-respected editors, they lack many of the other advantages enjoyed by \nlists; extensive marketing, sales, and distribution teams; and scale. As a \nthe Big Five: big back \nresult, those new entrants have barely made a dent in the relevant market -\ntheir collective share \nis less than one percent, see PX 968, and no one in the industry views them as substantial \ncompetitors to the Big Five. See Trial Tr. at 249:20-250:90 (Pande), 552:21-557:3 (Karp). \nMoreover, the growth of those new competitors was accompanied by a countervailing shrinkage \nin the market shares of other non-Big Five publishers: The stability of the overall market share \nFive publishers indicates that the new entrants have done little to change the \nof non-Big \ncompetitive landscape, and that barriers to entry and expansion remain high. See id. at 1482: 15-\n1483: 17 (Hill); PX 977. \nThe defendants contend that Big Five rivals like HarperCollins and well-funded \ncompanies like Disney are poised to expand in the relevant market. See Defs. PFOF ¶¶ 124-48; \nbecause they \nDefs. PCOL ¶¶ 81-83. To be sure, Big Five rivals face low barriers to expansion \nhave many of the same advantages that PRH and S&S have. But there is no evidence that \nHarperCollins, Hachette, or Macmillan could or would compete more aggressively with the \nmerged company. See Trial Tr. at 177:1-15 (Pietsch), 1088:8-14 (Weisberg), 1385:9-1386:11 \nFive \n(Murray). The distribution of market shares among PRH, S&S, and the other Big \nhas remained relatively constant in recent years. See PX 994. The Court has every \npublishers, \n73 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 73 of 80 \ncompete; \nreason to believe that all the industry players are already doing their best to \nit is \nexpand sufficiently \ntherefore unlikely that the non-merging Big Five publishers could suddenly \nto prevent the anticipated competitive harm. \nare \nTwo well-funded companies outside the Big Five highlighted by the defendants \nAmazon and Disney. Amazon acquired several high-priced books when it first started its \npublishing business about a decade ago, but it has failed to make significant headway in the \nindustry. See Trial Tr. at 172:17-25 (Pietsch). From 2019 to 2021, Amazon\'s share in acquiring \nthe publishing rights to anticipated top-selling books declined from under \nto under \nof \n. See PX 968 at 2. Amazon also struggles with selling its books outside \nits own \nconvinced \nplatform. See Trial Tr. at 171: 17-23 (Pietsch). The Court therefore is not \nthat \nAmazon is a significant competitive constraint in the relevant market. The defendants argue that \nresources \nSee Defs. PFOF ¶ 126. While Disney may have the motivation and financial \nto \nbarriers \nexecute the alleged plan, it will still face many of the previously discussed \nto entry. \nthe \nThere is no evidence to suggest that Disney is better equipped than Amazon to succeed in \nrelevant market. In addition, it is a strain to characterize Disney\'s five-year aspirational plan as \nevidence of "timely" market entry. See Staples II, 190 F. Supp. 3d at 133 ("The relevant time \nframe for consideration in this forward looking exercise is two to three years."). \n3. Additional Arguments \nof \nThe defendants raise a medley of other arguments based on (1) the power \nliterary \nagents to constrain anticompetitive behavior by publishers; (2) efficiencies from the merger that \nwill offset anticompetitive effects; (3) the lack of negative effects from the last major merger in \n74 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 74 of 80 \nhome" \nthe publishing industry; and (4) the parties\' interest in finding the "best \nfor S&S. The \nCourt will consider each of these in turn. \ni. Power of Agents \nthe \nThe defendants argue in post-trial briefing that the market-share data used by \ngovernment does not account for the control that agents wield over acquisition formats, which \nrenders the data unreliable. See Defs. PCOL ¶¶ 71-73 ("Market concentration statistics also \nignore the competitive effect of agents\' control over the bargaining process."). To the contrary, \nthe market-share data necessarily reflects agents\' existing practices with respect to acquisition \nformats. The market-share numbers aggregate individual book deals, each of which was \npresumably subject to an acquisition format that was determined by an agent. \nharm \nThe defendants also have argued that agents can constrain the competitive \nof the \nmerger through their control over acquisition formats. The defendants have suggested that even \nif some imprints are eliminated or consolidated after the merger, agents can readily find \n(Defs. \nsubstitutes for the missing imprints in any given auction. See Trial Tr. at 3276:8-3277:21 \nClosing) ("[T]here probably are hundreds, hundreds of these imprints spread around the various \npublishing houses .... [I]f the merger did functionally eliminate one potential participant, it will \nreadily \nnot necessarily change the dynamic of any given auction ... because the agent can \nwith another bidder."). Indeed, the defendants seem to treat agents as the \nreplace that publisher \nbuy-side analogue to "power buyers." "Courts have ... noted that the existence of power \ncustomers who retain strategies post-merger that may constrain the ability \nbuyers-sophisticated \nof the merging parties to raise prices -\nis a factor that can serve to rebut a prima facie case of \nanti-competitiveness." Wilhelmsen, 341 F. Supp. 3d at 70 (quotations omitted). \n75 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 75 of 80 \nis \nBut agents cannot create competition where it does not exist, and competition \nwhat \nultimately increases authors\' advances. See Trial Tr. at 114:25-115:6 (Pietsch), 596:5-597:4 \n(Karp), 251 :4-251 :20 (Pande ). The proposed merger would reduce the number of imprints \navailable to bid independently for any given book, so agents\' ability to play prospective \npublishers against one another would weaken. See Merger Guidelines§ 6.2 ("A merger between \ntwo competing [buyers] prevents [sellers] from playing those [buyers] off against each other in \nnegotiations. This alone can significantly enhance the ability and incentive of the merged entity \nto obtain a result more favorable to it, and less favorable to the [seller], than the merging firms \nwould have offered separately absent the merger."). \ndiscipline \nIn any event, as a general matter, agents do not have the power to effectively \nof \nlarge publishers. Time after time, when agents have attempted to curb the Big Five\'s exercise \nmarket power, the agents have failed. For example, agents were unsuccessful in attempts (1) to \nincrease e-book royalties, see Trial Tr. at 2101:12-2105:5 (Wylie) (boycott of Wylie by Random \nattempt to secure higher e-book royalties for authors); (2) to unlink audio rights \nHouse ended his \nfrom publishing rights, PX 328 at 2-3 ("Remember when Amazon was offering seven figures on \nafter big book until \nAudio before books were sold to publishers? We turned down big book \nagents realized we would not play in an auction without Audio. And now they always sell us \nAudio."); and (3) to prevent publishers from changing payment structures, see Trial Tr. at \n1828:19-1829:18 (Walsh) (describing publishers\' shift from paying out advances in halves to \npaying them out in quarters); PX 2008 (Fletcher) at 19-20 \nAll those contract terms were important to authors and agents, but they \nwere forced to back down in response to pressure from the Big Five. \n76 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 76 of 80 \nii. Efficiencies \nThe defendants argued at trial that efficiencies would limit the merger\'s anticipated \ncompetitive harm. Efficiencies alone might not suffice to rebut a prima facie case, but they "may \nnevertheless be relevant to the competitive effects analysis on the market required to determine \nwhether the proposed transaction will substantially lessen competition." Sysco, 113 F. Supp. 3d \nat 82 (quotations omitted). The Court, however, precluded the defendants\' evidence of \nefficiencies, after determining that the defendants had failed to verify the evidence, as required \nby law. See Trial Tr. at 2749:12-2772:24. Efficiencies therefore play no role in the instant \nanalysis. \niii. The 2013 Penguin-Random House Merger \nThe defendants argue that the 2013 Penguin-Random House merger was a "natural \nexperiment" that did not cause a decrease in advances paid for anticipated top-selling books. See \nDefs. PCOL ¶ 84 ( quoting Merger Guidelines § 2.1.2); see also Defs. PFOF ¶ 226. They are \ncorrect that analogous historical events are useful for considering the likely effects of a merger. \nSee Merger Guidelines § 2.1.2. \nBut the parties hotly dispute how the 2013 merger affected author advances. The \ndefendants assert that advances for anticipated top-selling books did not decrease due to the \nmerger, because they were already declining before the merger and continued to do so afterward. \nSee Defs. PFOF ¶ 227; Trial Tr. at 2841 :4-8 (Snyder), 2638:25-2639:14 (Snyder). The \ngovernment counters that advances paid for anticipated top-selling books decreased more \nrelative to other books\' advances after the 2013 merger. See Govt. PFOF-PCOL ¶¶ 238-42; \nTrial Tr. at 3066:2-10 (Hill); PX 966. Ultimately, the Court finds the evidence about the 2013 \nmerger inconclusive. The contraction in mass-market paperbacks around 2013 muddies the \n77 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 77 of 80 \nanalysis, and the intervening nine years have brought important shifts in the industry, such as \ncontinued consolidation. See Trial Tr. at 169:2-170:20 (Pietsch). Thus, the aftermath of the \n2013 merger does not affect the Court\'s analysis. \niv. A "Good Home" for S&S \nDefendants have argued that PRH is the best home for the authors, editors, and staff of \nS&S. See Defs. PFOF ¶¶ 22-24. Witnesses have noted that S&S authors would gain many \nadvantages from working with the combined entity, including access to PRH\'s distribution \nnetwork. See, e.g., Defs. PFOF ¶ 25 (PRH could bring its "industry-leading supply chain to bear \non S&S \'s books, enabling S&S to obtain more retail shelf space, enjoy higher sales, and reach \nmore readers." (citing Trial Tr. at 878:1-22 (Dohle))). Moreover, the defendants have suggested \nthat if the sale to PRH is enjoined, Paramount Global might sell S&S to a private equity firm that \nwould take on debt and "gut" the company. See Defs. PFOF ¶¶ 23-24; see also Trial Tr. at \n2094:20-2095:2 (Wylie) ("So if it were, for instance, to go to private equity ... , the private \nequity company wouldn\'t understand the business it was in; would, say, load it with debt as \nBlackstone did to Houghton Mifflin, basically destroying the publishing house so that it was sold \nat a discount later to one of the Big 5."), 1938:18-23 (Duhigg) ("And if [the merger] doesn\'t \nhappen, it will be disastrous for Simon & Schuster, because they will get acquired by private \nequity ... [a]nd they will gut that company."). \nThose arguments are not relevant to the Court\'s analysis of the government\'s claim under \nthe Clayton Act. The Court is required to assess the anticompetitive effects of the merger under \nthe applicable statute and case law, which do not contemplate consideration of the preferences of \nthe merging parties\' employees and stakeholders, or their distaste for other potential buyers of \nthe assets in question. The focus of the Court\'s inquiry is harm to competition in the relevant \n78 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 78 of 80 \nmarket. See, e.g., E. l du Pont de Nemours, 353 U.S. at 589, 592. Nevertheless, the Court notes \nthat the expressed concerns about a private-equity acquisition are highly speculative. Other \npotential buyers from the publishing industry have shown interest in acquiring S&S, and it is just \nas likely that another publishing company will prevail in a future sale. See Trial Tr. at 2185 :2-\n15 (Berkett). Nor is the Court moved by the desire of S&S and its employees to be acquired by \nPRH. It comes as no surprise that S&S would like to benefit from the extraordinary market \npower and other advantages that the combined entity would enjoy. The Court, however, must \nfocus on harm to competition in the relevant market. \nCONCLUSION \nThe government has presented a compelling case that predicts substantial harm to \ncompetition as a result of the proposed merger of PRH and S&S. It has properly  defined a \nrelevant market- focused on publishing rights for anticipated top-selling books -\nthat \nencompasses 70 percent of the advances that publishers pay to authors. The post-merger \nconcentration of the relevant market would be concerningly high: The merged entity would have \na 49-percent market share, more than twice that of its closest competitor. Moreover, the top two \ncompetitors would hold 7 4 percent of the market; and the top four market participants would \ncontrol 91 percent. The government has buttressed its market-share analysis with strong \nevidence of likely unilateral effects and coordinated effects that would hurt competition. \nThe defendants have failed to show that the relevant market is not well defined; have \nfailed to establish that the market-share data inaccurately reflects market conditions; and have \nfailed to rebut the government\'s affirmative evidence of anticompetitive harm. Contrary to the \ndefendants\' contentions, the relevant market appropriately identifies a submarket of targeted \nsellers -\nthe authors of anticipated top-selling books. Those authors have unique needs and \n79 \nCase 1:21-cv-02886-FYP Document 194 Filed 11/07/22 Page 79 of 80 \npreferences, have fewer outlets that can satisfy their requirements, and therefore are vulnerable \nto anticompetitive behavior. The Court is unpersuaded by the defendants\' arguments that the \nmarket-share data does not accurately reflect conditions in the relevant market because it does \nnot account for constraints that would be imposed by existing and new competitors, literary \nagents, and internal imprint competition. Nor have the defendants presented admissible evidence \nof efficiencies or any other evidence that changes the Court\'s view of the competitive landscape. \nAccordingly, the Court finds that the proposed merger of PRH and S&S violates \nSection 7 of the Clayton Act because it is likely to substantially lessen competition in the market \nfor the publishing rights to anticipated top-selling books. The Court therefore will enjoin the \nmerger. A separate order will issue this day. \n80 \nFLORENCE Y.
